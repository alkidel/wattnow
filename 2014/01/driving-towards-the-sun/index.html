<meta name="description" content="Did you hear? Ford revealed its new Ford C-Max Solar Energi concept car at CES 2014: a car equipped with 300W of semi-flexible rooftop solar (Sunpower) that can run quasi-entirely on solar charging without need to draw energy from the electric grid. The innovation in the system lies not only in the high-efficiency solar panels but also a unique charging station composed of solar concentrator and sun-tracking technology that allows to charge the car&#39;s battery in one day (as opposed to one week if the solar panels worked alone!). The canopy structure contains Fresnal lenses to &nbsp;concentrate the sun&#39;s energy on the panels, and moreover, the car is actually programmed to inch backward and forward to track the sun throughout the day! For the moment, the C-Max Solar Energi remains a &quot;concept car&quot; (clocking in a mere 21 electric-only miles per charge), but hopefully the project will kick other car companies into gear for other exciting solar-powered transport innovations." />
