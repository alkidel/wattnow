  content: Does anyone know what is the water loss in the rest of the industrialized
    world? In the United States the water loss from the reservoir to local treatment
    plant before being sent to everyones home is 1/3 of the water traveling in those
    pipes. Is the rest of the inndustrialized world as bad? My understanding is that
    water loss is nonrecoverable. The city of Ur repeating itself on a far grander
    scale.

  content: "Dear sir,\r\n\r\nWe are competent trader in South Korea having effective
    network in consumer market mainly focusing on health&amp;beauty products.\r\nThese
    days, our company comes to have high interest in all natural sleeping materials,
    and your company seems one of the best candidate to co-operate with.\r\nWe are
    willing to present this concept for baby or kids first, then want to spread out
    for the adults next.\r\nTwo products we intend to bring are kids' playmat and
    bedding mattress.\r\nEven we are not technical expert, our idea is to make these
    rather simple-i.e. composition of coco-mat+wools on top covered by 100% natural
    fabric of good skin touch.\r\nOf course, playmat is going with thinner than sleeping
    one, and you may know well how to optimize one and the other.\r\nI suppose some
    sort of binder need to be used in coco mat or to put wools on it, which seems
    one of concern in terms of bad odor and all natural concept.\r\n\r\nWe are earnest
    to drive this project, so that please give us feedback with your sincere advice.\r\n\r\nLook
    forward to your reply.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nJ.N.Choi\r\nC.E.O/Blucell Ltd"
