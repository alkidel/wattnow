      <p>Hey there, I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alki-delichatsios-84b8922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alki Delichatsios</a>. </p>
      <p>Watt Now was a professional adventure I started in 2011 to explore the cleantech world as I transitioned from working in the nuclear industry to the renewable energy sector. Along the way, I decided to share the 100+ exciting projects I discovered with this blog Watt Now. I hope (one day!) to follow up on these companies and projects to see how they are doing (and see if they still exist!), but in the meantime, here are the articles as written at the time from 2011-2014. <strong>Enjoy. </strong>
       <!--  After volunteering for <a href="http://www.earthsparkinternational.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EarthSpark International</a> (a social enterprise in Haiti) and working for the <a href="https://www.iea.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Energy Agency</a>, I joined <a href="http://dualsun.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DualSun</a> (2-in-1 solar panel manufacturer) in early 2013 as Head of Marketing, and I have been pursuing this crazy fun, passionate solar journey ever since. --></p>
