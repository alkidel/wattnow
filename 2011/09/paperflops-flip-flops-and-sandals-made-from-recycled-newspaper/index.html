<meta name="description" content="PaperFlops&nbsp;employs underprivileged people, including street children and disabled people, at a creative workshop in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to convert newspapers and other waste ... &nbsp;into flip flops ! &nbsp;And beyond being recycled, they are just really cool-looking flip flops. It takes about 1kg of old newspaper, and some other natural materials (root from old palm trees, coconut shells, and 100% natural rubber) to make a pair of PaperFlops. &nbsp; And the flip flops are protected with a natural rubber sealant -- so not only are the flip flops recycled and stylish, but they are durable and water proof too! The PaperFlops are currently distributed for 26euro on Ulule, a crowdfunding platform, kind of like Kickstarter but with a more social and environmental focus. When I was in Laos, I came across a similar project called&nbsp;Peuan Mit&nbsp;(&quot;Close Friend&quot; in Lao) dedicated to helping street children re-integrate into Lao society with a number of training solutions - including a delicious restaurant called Makphet&nbsp;and an awesome little store called the Noi Noi Shop with crafts made out of recycled materials and made by the parents of street children. &nbsp;I got this cool newspaper-purse at the shop which I still use after 4 years: If you&#39;re in Vientiene, you must check out the Makphet restaurant and Noi Noi shop. If you won&#39;t be in Vientiene anytime soon, but you find yourself in the Boulder area, you should check out MomentuM, a store which carries beatiful handmade crafts often made from recycled materials. But first step, I just ordered my&nbsp;PaperFlops. &nbsp;Did you?" />
