<meta name="description" content="Konarka develops &quot;Power Plastic&quot;, a thin and flexible organic photovoltaic technology that can be easily integrated into building materials like curtain walls and windows (which is known as BIPV - building integrated photovoltaics), remote flexible structures like bus stops in San Francisco, or even portable products like tents or backpacks! Konarka&#39;s Power Plastic is based on a photo-reactive polymer material, and though it has a lower efficiency than conventional crystalline silicon solar panels, its low-cost for materials, manufacturing, and maintenance, coupled with on-going research to improve the efficiency allow huge potential for Power Plastics to lead the solar industry. On top of all that, Power Plastic is the only thin-film PV technology that uses all recyclable materials! Either Konarka has an extremely convincing marketing team - or Solar Plastic really does have huge potential (I think it&#39;s the latter). &nbsp;Visit Konarka&#39;s website and read about the progress of the technology and the&nbsp;interesting projects they&#39;re working on. Konarka is based in Lowell, MA with offices in Germany and Japan." />
