BGET has three focus areas: Renewable energy and appropriate technology Technical education and capacity building Sustainability in rural development BGET teams work on energy (solar, micro-hydro, and bio-gas) and water (pumps and purification systems) projects, and educate and train refugees with the systems to create a local, sustainable, and empowered community. BGET has quite a successful record after only six years, including constructing and operating 7 micro-hydro systems and training over 300 Karen village leaders on Solar Home Systems (SHS) repair and maintenance. You can get involved by donating or volunteering! Six months in Thailand, working on solar panels and teaching excited students - sounds awesome to me." />
