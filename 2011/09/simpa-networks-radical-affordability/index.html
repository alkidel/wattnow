<meta name="description" content="Simpa Networks, based in Bangalore, India, provides affordable access to solar energy through a &quot;pay as you go&quot; system for using and eventually purchasing solar home systems (SHS). The fact is - over 2 billion people in the world have unreliable access to electricity, and the majority of these people rely on kerosene for light. &nbsp;Kerosene is dirty, inefficient, presents health risks, and ultimately, is very expensive with its high operating costs. &nbsp;However, the advantage of kerosene is its low initial cost and its usage flexibility. Small-scale solar home systems are much more appropriate than kerosene for meeting the needs of the consumers at the &quot;base of the economic of the pyramid&quot; (BoP) - however, the upfront cost ($200-400) is the limiting factor in widespread usage of these systems. &nbsp;Though SHS systems are also undoubtedly more economical in the long-term than kerosene (over the 10-year life of an SHS system, a household would spend about $1500-2000 on equivalent costs for kerosene lighting), households simply can not afford the high upfront cost. Simpa Networks has developed a solar solution with an innovative&nbsp;pricing model&nbsp;to compete with kerosene products. &nbsp;With Simpa Networks&#39; Progressive Purchase technology, the consumer makes a prepayment for a certain quantity of kWh which unlocks the solar home system. When the payment has run out, the system is disable until a new prepayment is made. &nbsp;Once the consumer has fully paid the total price of the product, the system is permanently unlocked. As they put it, &quot;mobile phones are the great leapfrog story of the past decade. &nbsp;distributed solar is next&quot;. And I totally agree. &nbsp;In order for the BoP to have widespread adoption of clean and reliable energy, we need to think differently about the economics. And clearly, Simpa Networks is doing just that." />
