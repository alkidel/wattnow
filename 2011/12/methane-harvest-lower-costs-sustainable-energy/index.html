<meta name="description" content="Methane Harvest, based in Cambridge, MA, delivers a genius solution for waste water treatment plants which converts the plant&#39;s waste into electricity and heating. &nbsp;Moreover, MH&#39;s innovative build-own-operate model&nbsp;provides a risk-free, cheap, local, and clean electricity solution for the plant and the plant&#39;s community. We all know that Watt Now loves anaerobic digesters (processing organic waste to produce methane as fuel), as we&#39;ve seen with Purpose, Park Spark, Sanergy, and Harvest. Methane Harvest is another great project integrating the bio-digester concept. &nbsp;But they doesn&#39;t actually build the bio-digesters - Rather, Methane Harvest leverages the fact that bio-digesters already exist at water treatment plants, and provides on-site&nbsp;Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems&nbsp;that are fueled by the plant&#39;s digester methane. Methane Harvest&#39;s Combined Heat and Power system occupies 400ft2 and provides 100% of a plant&#39;s heating needs. Methane Harvest&#39;s CHP system can provide 100% of the plant&#39;s heat needs and &gt;30% of the electricity needs. And what&#39;s most exciting about Methane Harvest&#39;s solution -- is the business model. &nbsp;Methane Harvest assumes all costs associated with the CHP and in return, contracts with the plant&#39;s municipality to purchase electricity generated at below-market rates under a 20-year agreement. &quot;We build it. &nbsp;We own it. &nbsp;We operate it. &nbsp;You save.&quot; Methane Harvest&#39;s model is a creatively-designed&nbsp;Power Purchase Agreement, a model we&#39;re starting to see more and more with solar projects, like SolSolution&nbsp;does for solar panels on schools. Specific application. &nbsp;Proven technology. &nbsp;Creative business model. &nbsp;And local. &nbsp;Awesome." />
