<meta name="description" content="Wind-it, a joint project between two Paris-based companies,&nbsp;Elioth and Encore Heureux, is an innovative solution for superposing wind-turbines on existing power transmission and cell phone towers. I had a discussion recently with an employee of Second Wind&nbsp;about the wind industry - and how innovations in the industry are mostly incremental and not as exciting as projects we&#39;re seeing in the solar industry. But Wind-it blows me away. &nbsp;Pun intended. Wind blows harder at higher altitudes, so traditional wind turbines are usually built on very tall &quot;pylons&quot; (towers) generally made from rare metals. The Wind-it concept is designed to build on existing transmission networks, expanding wind-generated electricity without the need for new tall pylons -- and in effect reducing rare metal needs, investment costs, and added visual pollution. The idea is simple - install small vertical axis wind generators&nbsp;on existing pylons, coupled with wind guidance systems such as sails, reinforcing winds towards the generator. &nbsp;The electricity produced can then easily be re-integrated into the electrical grid. Here-below is an example of a vertical axis wind generator, produced by&nbsp;Urban Green Energy. Wind-it is targeting emerging countries, since pylons in these regions are growing at a fast rate for power transmission and cell phone towers -- a fact that was very evident for me when I was in Haiti, where even the remotest of villages are dotted with multiple new cell phone towers powered by diesel generators (that could eventually be replaced by Wind-it systems!). But even in a country like France, if 1/3 of the existing pylons were retrofitted with Wind-it turbines, we could generate the equivalent electricity of 2 nuclear power plants. The Wind-it design was first developed in 2007, and since then, has received a European patent, is listed as one of The Blue Economy projects, and is currently being prototyped. I love this idea of making a small change to an existing infrastructure to generate electricity - I&#39;m curious to understand better the cost and time investment needed to integrate the Wind-it system, but theoretically (or I hope realistically!), we could be installing thousands of these tiny systems and producing wind-generated electricity within 2-3 years -- while highly political large-scale projects, like off-shore wind farms or nuclear plants, would still be in &quot;discussion&quot;. via The Blue Economy" />
