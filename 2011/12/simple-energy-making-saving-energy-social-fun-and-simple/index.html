<meta name="description" content="Based in Boulder, CO, Simple Energy&nbsp;is developing an online platform that engages consumers to understand their energy usage and compete with their Facebook friends in order to save energy (and money) in a fun and simple way. The Simple Energy solution meets a four-fold objective, as described on their website: Customer Engagement -&nbsp;Building connections between utilities and their customers. Energy Efficiency -&nbsp;Changing behavior and boosting energy efficiency sign ups. Demand Response -&nbsp;Driving customer load shifting and increasing auto-DR participation. Smart Grid -&nbsp;Providing customers a fun way to understand and interact with the smart grid. Sounds a lot like Opower. &nbsp;And similar to Opower, Simple Energy combines behavioral science and game mechanics to engage their customers. &nbsp;A little competition is a good thing, right? An interesting tidbit about Simple Energy is that they have Dan Ariely has a scientific advisor. &nbsp;Dan Ariely was one of my favorite professors at MIT (in 15.301 Managerial Psychology) and an expert in behavioral economics. &nbsp;I imagine he provides valuable input on how to leverage the irrational behavior of humans in designing Simple Energy&#39;s platform. Simple Energy recently raised $900,000 in funding from angel investors, and if you want to live in Boulder, they are currently hiring! Sounds like a pretty awesome place to work&nbsp;- pets are encouraged, beer is provided, ski pass included, ... oh yea, and you&#39;d get some equity stake in the company too. Thanks Lola for the info!" />
