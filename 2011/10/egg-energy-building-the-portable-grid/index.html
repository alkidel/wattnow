<meta name="description" content="EGG-energy&nbsp;is a for-profit social enterprise, targeting the off-grid market in Tanzania to provide a battery subscription service. &nbsp;As they put it, EGG-energy is the &quot;netflix&quot; of power. 86% of the population in Tanzania is not connected to the grid. &nbsp;Ironically, of those 35 millions without electricity, 80% live within 5km of the grid. &nbsp;EGG-energy&#39;s netflix model bridges that gap. What&#39;s so special about getting electricity from the grid? &nbsp;Basically, for those not connected to the grid, a typical household spends about $165 per year on kerosene for lighting, disposable batteries for radio and mobile phone charging services. &nbsp;That adds up to more than 10% of the household&#39;s income. &nbsp;Let&#39;s say you make $50,000 per year. &nbsp;Could you imagine spending over $400 per month on electricity? &nbsp;The more I learn about these rural areas with less developed infrastructure, the more I realize how expensive it is to be poor (as the CEO Jamie Yang put it nicely). With EGG-energy&#39;s battery service, the customer can either pay a lower annual subscription fee and then a small fee each time he/she swaps a depleted battery, or, pay a higher subscription fee and get free unlimited swapping (which customers appear to prefer). When we say batteries, we&#39;re not talking AA. &nbsp;We&#39;re talking about a solid brick-size battery that will last 5 nights and power a household&#39;s lighting, radios, and phone charging. &nbsp;Robust enough to power your house or small business - light enough to carry with one hand and exchange on a weekly basis. Battery carried on the basket of a bicycle EGG-energy offers its customers comprehensive electricity services at a much lower price than current expenditures. &nbsp;Moreover, by replacing kerosene and wasteful disposable batteries, this battery netflix model not only expands access to electricity, but provides a cleaner and more efficient solution. As of April 2011, EGG-energy has two&nbsp;charging stations&nbsp;(via grid connection) in Chanika and Mbagala, both on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam. &nbsp;EGG-energy also partners with &quot;contracted distributors&quot;, existing store owners who agree to swap EGG batteries in addition to normal activities in order to earn more revenue. &nbsp;Each charging site has five associated distribution sites, allowing end-user customers to easily access the batteries even at far distances from the charging sites. &nbsp;EGG-energy also started a solar pilot in Msanga (a rural village 100km from Dar es Salaam) and is working with an Iringa entrepreneur (5ookm from Dar es Salaam) to set up an on-grid franchise in the village. This model is fantastic and obviously addresses the similar challenge of energy poverty that EarthSpark is addressing in Haiti. &nbsp;EarthSpark&#39;s current equivalent solution to EGG-energy&#39;s battery model is distributing Barefoot Power&#39;s 15W Solar Home System to the off-grid market in Haiti. The solar home system includes a similar battery to the one EGG-energy distributes. However, instead of charging the battery remotely, the battery is charged directly at the house with the 15W solar panel provided in the solar home kit. &nbsp;The added advantage of this sort of system is that the customer is autonomous and the battery is charged directly at his or her house. &nbsp;But I imagine this advantage most likely comes at an added cost as compared to the EGG-energy solution. In any case, the EGG-energy model is an exciting solution to providing cheaper and cleaner electricity to the off-grid market in Tanzania. My only question - is if households in Tanzania are so close to existing grid infrastructure, why not just extend the grid or make &quot;micro-grids&quot;? &nbsp;Is this too cost-prohibitive? Update (Nov 2): EGG-Energy&#39;s Blandine Antoine responded to my question with the following: &quot;Upfront capital expenditure is much higher; since government will not pay for it, end-customers would have to; upfront costs would be in the several thousands of dollars to get the lines to a single house.&quot; &#39;Nuff said. &nbsp;Great work, EGG-Energy!" />
