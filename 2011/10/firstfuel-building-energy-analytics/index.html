<meta name="description" content="FirstFuel&#39;s &quot;zero-touch&quot; software provides an extremely fast and simple approach to energy efficiency for commercial buildings. What do we mean by &quot;zero-touch&quot;? FirstFuel&#39;s&nbsp;Rapid Building Assessment (RBA) Platform&nbsp;is remote and automated - no need for audits, devices, or connections. &nbsp;Instead, FirstFuel requires two simple inputs: 1) One year of the building&#39;s energy consumption data (easily provided by the utility) and 2) The building&#39;s address - which quickly identifies local weather data and GIS data. With these two inputs, FirstFuel&#39;s super sophisticated patent-pending analytical engine will process the data to provide a comprehensive building analysis and customized operational and retrofit recommendations. &nbsp;Moreover, FirstFuel&#39;s RBA platform provides monitoring tools to track energy savings over time. It&#39;s fast. &nbsp;And cheap. But... are you losing quality by replacing a detailed onsite audit by a remote analysis? &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;In fact, not at all. Both Fraunhofer and Cadmus Institutes have audited FirstFuel&#39;s systems and found the results to be within 2-10% of meter values -- ya know, at a fraction of the time and cost. Moreover, the FirstFuel system has had tremendous success with its pilot case in Lexington, MA. &nbsp;Lexington used FirstFuel&#39;s RBAs on five of the largest energy consuming buildings, and the analysis and results have&nbsp;delivered 7% operational savings&nbsp;- without any investments necessary. I don&#39;t know much about smart buildings and energy efficiency - but it seems that FirstFuel&#39;s remote and simulating approach is quite revolutionary and could shake things up. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t hurt that they recently received $2.4 million in initial funding from Battery Ventures and Nth Power." />
