<meta name="description" content="Every wednesday, One Block Off the Grid&nbsp;publishes an awesome infographic about energy. I thought this infographic on traveling and the greenest way to get somewhere&nbsp;in terms of pounds of CO2 emitted per trip&nbsp;- car, bus, train, or airplane - was particularly informative. I am however, a bit confused about the emissions associated with taking a plane. &nbsp;They seem very low -- to go across the country from NYC to Los Angeles, flying is less pollutant than taking a train? I always thought flying was by far the least green way of getting somewhere. &nbsp;This article&nbsp;does a similar transport comparison with results which are pretty consistent with the infographic - except for the airplane emissions (the article says ~2,500 lbs CO2 from NYC to San Francisco). &nbsp;Any thoughts? &nbsp;Maybe I&#39;ll contact 1BOG about this." />
