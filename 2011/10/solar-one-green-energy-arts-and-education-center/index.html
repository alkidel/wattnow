<meta name="description" content="I truly believe that the local community is a powerful platform for change. &nbsp;And that&#39;s why I really like Solar One. &nbsp;Located in Steyvesant Cove Park in Manhattan, Solar One is a solar-powered &quot;hub&quot; for New Yorkers focused on energy. Solar One&#39;s mission is to empower residents and visitors with the knowledge and resources about energy to move forward and create a cleaner and more sustainable future. Solar One does this through outreach, educational programs (like the Green Design Lab implemented in New York schools), trainings (for example, building analyst, solar installation), and even with the arts, organizing an annual Green Energy Arts Festival and many other integrated energy-arts events like the Solar-Powered Film Series. Since its inception in 2003, Solar One has been largely successful, so much so that they intend to expand with&nbsp;Solar 2, a space that is 10x the size of Solar One and the first carbon-neutral, net-zero energy building in New York City. &nbsp;Solar 2 is expected to open in 2012. The local energy one-stop wonderland. Awesome." />
