<meta name="description" content="It almost seems like magic the way that Alphabet Energy, based in San Francisco, CA, can turn waste heat - like exhaust coming out of your car, or a factory chimney spewing out hot steam - into electricity. Initially developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Alphabet Energy&#39;s silicon-based thermoelectric technology has &quot;cracked the code&quot; for turning silicon into an efficient thermoelectric material. What are thermoelectrics exactly? &nbsp;When a thermoelectric material (in Alphabet&#39;s case, a silicon product) experiences a temperature difference (ie. is exposed to waste heat), the device creates a voltage difference. &nbsp;A voltage difference will then lead to an electric current. Seems so simple, right? &nbsp;Totally. &nbsp;The trouble is designing a technology that is efficient, inexpensive, and scalable. &nbsp;And it seems Alphabet Energy has hit the spot on all three. Alphabet&#39;s products are particularly interesting for industrial facilities, which could meet 25-100% of their electricity needs from waste heat. Also, the US Army and US Airforce, which are constantly looking to boost energy efficiency in the military&#39;s battlefield operations through their Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs, have&nbsp;signed over $1 million in Phase II contracts with Alphabet&nbsp;for special field applications. Alphabet aims to reach full commercialization in 2012/2013 and be the world leader in the heat recovery industry with its fabless manufacturing model. &nbsp;We&#39;re talking about an $100 billion global market. Probably not a bad place to look for a job. &nbsp;Hmm." />
