<meta name="description" content="Incubated at Columbia&#39;s Graduate School of Architecture, the LuminAID solar lamp&nbsp;is an ultra-portable, water-proof, solar-powered lamp. &nbsp; The LuminAID lamp&#39;s solar system is designed for people without regular access to electricity and for victims of a natural disaster. &nbsp;In other words, the lamp is designed to be robust, portable, waterproof, and ... a safer and more cost-effective alternative to kerosene lamps -- very similar to the NOKERO lamps that I wrote about last week. What I find especially awesome about the design of the LuminAID lamp is its ultra-compactness. &nbsp;You can pack and ship up to 50 LuminAID inflatable lamps for every 8 equivalent solar lightbulbs. (You then inflate the lamp into a pillow-shape to help diffuse the light) After my experience in Haiti last month and starting to understand the absurd complexity associated with supply chain and distribution systems, I really appreciate the value of this compact shipping advantage. &nbsp;To give you an idea, for the NOKERO lamps that we were distributing in Haiti, the cost of distribution was higher than the cost of manufacturing. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know about you, but I thought that was nuts. &nbsp;Making a solar bulb? &nbsp;Easy as cake. &nbsp;Getting it from China to Haiti - yea see ya in six months. Anyway, just goes to show you that Anna and Andrea&nbsp;(the two brains&nbsp;behind LuminAID) really thought about every aspect of an appropriate design. Right on!" />
