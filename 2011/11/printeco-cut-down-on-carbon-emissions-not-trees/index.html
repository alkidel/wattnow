<meta name="description" content="Don&#39;t you hate when you print an excel file and you get 1 useful page of cells, and then 10 near-blank pages of random columns that you don&#39;t even care about? Headquartered in Chicago,&nbsp;PrintEco&nbsp;provides a set of plugins for your computer to optimize the content of documents you are printing in order to reduce printing costs - and your carbon footprint. It may seem minor, but according to a study by Lexmark, 17% of annual company printing is wasteful. &nbsp;And yes, it&#39;s best to avoid printing in the first place, but sometimes you gotta have that paper in front of you. &nbsp;In that case, ... Don&#39;t Just Print. &nbsp;PrintEco. It&#39;s incredibly cheap too! &nbsp;For an individual, you get a free trial up to the first 100 pages saved, and then after that it&#39;s only $5 for the software. &nbsp;And the Office version (also ridiculously cheap at $11) includes analytics software so that a company can measure the financial and environmental impact of using PrintEco. Seriously, if your company is looking for ways to &quot;green&quot; the officespace, I think you can&#39;t get a better value in terms of cost-simplicity-effectiveness than PrintEco. Also,&nbsp;PrintEco recently won &quot;Green Start-Up of the Year&quot; at the Opportunity Green conference in LA on Nov 10/11. Right on! Now, please make plugins for Chrome and Safari too. (for the moment, the plugins are limited to Microsoft Office and Explorer)" />
