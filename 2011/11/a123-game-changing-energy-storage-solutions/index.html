<meta name="description" content="A123, an MIT spinoff with headquarters in Watertown, MA, produces advanced Nanophosphate&reg;&nbsp;lithium ion batteries for transportation, grid, and commercial applications. A123&#39;s core technology is designed to be longer-life, more efficient, more durable, and safer than existing generation batteries (lead-acid, sodium-sulfur, nickel-cadmium...). A123 products have already penetrated the electric vehicle (EV) market and expect to grow in this field in particular with GM and a new entrant Fisker. &nbsp;This is fantastic and all --&nbsp;but what really excites me are A123&#39;s storage solutions for grid applications. Las week, Laurel Mountain, a 98 MW wind farm in West Virginia opened ... with 1.3 million of A123&#39;s batteries&nbsp;! Energy storage as we all know, is a big issue, especially for intermittent energy sources like wind and solar. For instance, winds blow stronger at night, when demand is low, and often don&#39;t blow at all during the day, when we need energy the most! Ideally, we&#39;d like to store the energy produced at night to be used the following day. But the A123 storage system is not designed for this &quot;long-term&quot; storage -- the batteries are tiny, only C and D in size! Instead, the storage system resolves intermittency issues on a much smaller scale --- and when I say small, I mean minutes. Apparently, even in the span of an hour, the output of the wind farm could vary from 98 MW to zero, and up to 40% within couple minute intervals. The A123 battery system helps smooth out those &quot;kinks&quot; in order to have a more efficient grid utilization, and essentially make more money. Pretty fascinating huh? &nbsp;We should follow the operations of the wind farm to see if the A123 battery system is performing as expected (and returning on the $25M investment!).
