<meta name="description" content="Electronic waste. &nbsp;A vast topic, issue, disaster, pile of dangerous shit - whatever you want to call it - for one blog post. But today we&#39;ll focus on Free Geek, a non-profit organization based in Portland, Oregon with a two-fold mission: 1) recycle technology in a clean, safe, and responsible manner and 2) provide access to computers, the internet, education, and job skills in return for community service. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong - but unlike in Europe where the&nbsp;Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive&nbsp;(WEEE Directive) imposes the responsibility of the disposal of electronic waste on the manufacturer itself, the US has no federal law that enforces this sort of &quot;Extended Producer Responsibility&quot;. &nbsp;Some states have their own laws dealing with e-waste like California which bans e-waste going to landfills or overseas. But in any case, it&#39;s messy. &nbsp;And until we get some clean regulation on e-waste policy, it&#39;s a good thing there are places like Free Geek. Free Geek collects donated computers and &quot;lovingly&quot; refurbishes them into working machines running the Ubuntu Linux operating system. &nbsp;They do this through their Build Program, which teaches volunteers how to build a computer, and in exchange for the volunteer&#39;s hard work (he has to commit to building 5 computers), the volunteer gets the 6th computer he builds for himself! The re-vamped computers then go to either the Adoption Program (to be explained),&nbsp;local non-profits, or Free Geek&#39;s&nbsp;thrift store. For the computers that can&#39;t be refurbished, Freek Geek&#39;s volunteers de-manufacture the machines and separate the components to be sent to local industrial recyclers. &nbsp;Free Geek only works with companies that handle the materials in an environmentally responsible manner (no hazardous waste is sent overseas, no recyclable materials are sent to a landfill, ....), in line with standards laid out by the Basel Action Network (BAN). These volunteers are part of the Adoption Program, and after 24 hours of volunteer service, they &quot;adopt&quot; one of the computers refurbished by the Build Program. Free Geek financially operates primarily through their&nbsp;thrift store sales, but also with fundraising and donations. &nbsp;In addition to Portland, some other cities have started their own Free Geek organizations, including Chicago, Providence, and Seattle. I like it. &nbsp;Bring people together. &nbsp;Learn how to build a computer. &nbsp;Recycle valuable components. &nbsp;Be responsible. &nbsp;Free Geek gets a big A+ in my book. Do YOU remember what you did with your last computer? I&#39;m lucky since my brother-in-law has a &quot;Mac Museum&quot; and has taken all my old computers for his personal collection.
