<meta name="description" content="From the same guys that developed the Humdinger technology comes... B-Squares! This is ... awesome. How do I explain?&nbsp; It&#39;s a system based on modules or &quot;squares&quot; - each standard in shape and size.&nbsp; Each module serves a certain function - any function really (so far they&#39;ve developed the battery square, the LED square, the iPhone square, and more ...) -- and YOU can even program what you want it to do - especially with the arduino module.&nbsp; The squares have magnetic edges, allowing them to &quot;snap into&quot; one another. Above all, the idea is that squares are powered with the &quot;fundamental square&quot; which is the solar square. Example - you&#39;re at a picnic and a) your iPhone is dead, and/or b) you want to play music.&nbsp; Just hook up the Solar square to the iPhone square which serves as a charger, a dock, and possible a connector to Speaker squares. From ANYWHERE (as long as there&#39;s sun.&nbsp; But otherwise, just bring along the Battery square). It&#39;s portable.&nbsp; It&#39;s functional.&nbsp; And most of all, B-Squares brings renewable energy to the individual.&nbsp; It&#39;s shifting the paradigm. If you still don&#39;t totally get it, here&#39;s a video that explains it all: The project is currently on Kickstarter, so if you want to be more involved, invest in B-Squares! I&#39;m extremely excited about my B-Ginner&#39;s Kit (Solar Square, Battery Square, and LED Square)..... &nbsp;" />

<p>How do I explain?&nbsp; It's a system based on modules or "squares" - each standard in shape and size.&nbsp; Each module serves a certain function - any function really (so far they've developed the battery square, the LED square, the iPhone square, and more ...) -- and YOU can even program what you want it to do - especially with the arduino module.&nbsp; The squares have magnetic edges, allowing them to "snap into" one another.</p>
<p>Above all, the idea is that squares are powered with the "fundamental square" which is the <strong>solar square</strong>.</p>
<p>Example - you're at a picnic and a) your iPhone is dead, and/or b) you want to play music.&nbsp; Just hook up the <strong>Solar square</strong> to the <strong>iPhone square</strong> which serves as a charger, a dock, and possible a connector to <strong>Speaker squares.</strong> From ANYWHERE (as long as there's sun.&nbsp; But otherwise, just bring along the <strong>Battery square</strong>).</p>

<p>It's portable.&nbsp; It's functional.&nbsp; And most of all, B-Squares brings renewable energy to the individual.&nbsp; It's shifting the paradigm.</p>
<p>If you still don't totally get it, here's a video that explains it all:</p>

<p>The project is currently on Kickstarter, so if you want to be more involved, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmcrae/b-squares-modular-solar-powered-electrics">invest in B-Squares</a>!</p>
<p>I'm extremely excited about my B-Ginner's Kit (Solar Square, Battery Square, and LED Square).....</p>
