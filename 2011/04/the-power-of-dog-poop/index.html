<meta name="description" content="The Park Spark Project was started by conceptual artist Matthew Mazzotta interested in exploring the relationship between people and their environment. The concept is simple and beautiful (...though maybe a bit stinky): convert dog poop into usable methane gas to power a lamp (or other uses -- they&#39;re open to ideas!) using an anaerobic methane digester.&nbsp; This principle is similar to that of Purpose Energy, Inc, which I wrote about last week, which converts brewery waste into usable energy also using a methane digester. The site does a good job of explaining in a really simple way how it works, and why burning methane is better than just releasing it into the environment directly (as what happens when organic waste is disposed in a landfill). &nbsp;The project is based in Cambridge, MA. Thanks Mick for the tip." />
