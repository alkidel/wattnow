<meta name="description" content="Sanergy was started by a group of MIT grads - a mix of MBAs, engineers, and designers - to develop an innovative model of sustainable sanitation for the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. The primary objective of the project is to create clean and affordable sanitation.&nbsp; Sanergy takes this objective further by developing a model that not only provides clean toilets, but then uses the human waste products to produce energy, all designed in a way to create a solution that is clean, sustainable, and economic every step of the way. The model has three parts - First, creating a network of low-cost, robust sanitation centers, for people to access clean toilets and showers (either on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis).&nbsp; The idea is that these centers be funding by micro-finance banks and run by local entrepreneurs. Second, collecting the waste, which is stored in air-tight containers, and then transported to a centralized processing center with an optimized distribution network. Third, processing the waste with an anaerobic digester to generate biogas for producing electricity.&nbsp; The remaining solid waste of the biogas generation will then be used as high-quality fertilizer. Sanergy reminds me of&nbsp;Park Spark Project.&nbsp; Using an anaerobic digester to turn poop into energy.&nbsp; Obviously two very different applications.&nbsp; But both demonstrating the exciting and creative potential of turning waste into energy. In May, Sanergy won MIT&#39;s $100K business plan competition and more recently won the Echoing Green Fellowship -- now that the guys behind the idea have graduated, they will have the time (and money!) to go fully implement the project.&nbsp; Congratulations and good luck! Thanks Millie for the info!" />
