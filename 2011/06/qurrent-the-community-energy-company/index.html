<meta name="description" content="Like SolaRoad, Qurrent is a Netherlands-based company - is it just me, or is the Netherlands a real hotbed for creative energy projects? Anyway, Qurrent provides &quot;intelligent systems&quot; for Local Energy Networks to allow for sharing, optimization, administration, and visualization. In other words, for a community that uses a decentralized energy source (example 1BOG - which helps coordinate local group purchases of solar energy in order to optimize costs), Qurrent&#39;s products - Qbox, Qserver, Qmunity, Qpps, optimize energy production and consumption by the following: 1. Collecting all relevant data regarding energy consumption and patterns, and optimize usage by &quot;switching&quot; appliances when most efficient (Qbox) 2. Storing all data collected from the Qbox, to be presented on the Qmunity website (Qserver) 3.

Again, after working with centralized, extremely high power-generating systems (nuclear), I&#39;m really interested in decentralized systems and bringing energy - the source, the distribution, the utiliziation - to a local level.
