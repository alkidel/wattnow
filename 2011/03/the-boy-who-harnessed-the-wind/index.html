    <p>It's been a while since I read this book.&nbsp; And while the saying goes "don't judge a book by it's cover", I admit- I was kind of attracted by the cover of this book.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/the-boy-who-harnessed-the-wind-creating-4638304.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-45" title="the-boy-who-harnessed-the-wind-creating--4638304" src="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/the-boy-who-harnessed-the-wind-creating-4638304-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>It's inviting, isn't it?</p>
<p>And moreover, the book is great.&nbsp; And incredibly inspiring (I'm still thinking about it a lot now- 4 months later).&nbsp; William Kamkwamba grew up in Malawi, and though he had very little formal education, he self-taught himself about energy systems by reading textbooks at the public library (in particular a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-Energy-Macmillan-McGraw-Hill-Science/dp/002276142X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1301101224&amp;sr=8-1">"Using Energy"</a> which now seems very difficult to find).&nbsp; And through enormous determination, and surviving numerous hardships (multiple famines, poverty, family illnesses), he successfully built a 12-watt windmill (using materials rummaged from waste - spare bicycle parts, a tractor fan blade and an old shock absorber, and fashioned blades from plastic pipe, ...).&nbsp; Which is enough power to charge cell phones.&nbsp; And power small lights.</p>
<p>And though the story is quite heavy and tragic at times, there are many moments that are full of curiosity and fun - and it gets technical too! But never to the point of getting into too much boring detail -- just enough to make you want to go take apart and tinker with your gadgets (which is getting harder and harder these days - the only thing I could think of taking apart is my electric toothbrush.&nbsp; You can't tinker so much with an iPhone or a laptop...).</p>
<p>And if my estimation is correct, after all that William's done (designed and built the windmill, wrote a book, TED fellow, initiating and particupating in numerous interesting projects, in particular, <a href="http://movingwindmills.org/projects">Moving Windmills</a>, ....), he's today ONLY 24!&nbsp; wow.</p>
<p>Anyway, my (maybe stupid) question now is, what about small-scale windmills (that you put on your roof for example, like solar panels)?&nbsp; I imagine there is stuff going on.&nbsp; Or maybe not.&nbsp; And though I don't know much about wind, I know the higher your turbine is, the more efficient your system will be.&nbsp; So what about kite windmills that you stabilize on your rooftop?&nbsp; I guess there's a problem if the wind stops and your kite falls. Hm.</p>
<p>I will try to investigate further on these options.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you have a chance, read William's story.</p>
