<meta name="description" content="Following the traumatic events last week in Japan, I was surprised by the media - both pleasantly and a bit worriedly, and how much coverage and focus was devoted to the nuclear accident(s) at Fukushima. I say &quot;pleasantly&quot; with respect to how much detail was provided to help people understand what was going on - the New York Times did (and is still doing) an especially good job -- at providing detailed articles on various technical and social aspects, real-time updates, and impressive interactive animations like this one describing spent fuel pools. I say &quot;worriedly&quot; with respect to how alarming some of the messages were - the European Commission likened the situation to an &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, other sources claimed &quot;Worse than Chrenobyl&quot; ,... which we all knew was not the case - but -&nbsp; to be fair, even last Tuesday and Wednesday, it was uneasy to grasp that the situation was getting worse instead of better. And through all this coverage, I think many of us felt that there was quite a lot of unclear and mixed messages about radiation and doses and limits and contamination ...

    <p>Following the traumatic events last week in Japan, I was surprised by the media - both pleasantly and a bit worriedly, and how much coverage and focus was devoted to the nuclear accident(s) at Fukushima.</p>
<p>I say "pleasantly" with respect to how much detail was provided to help people understand what was going on - the New York Times did (and is still doing) an especially good job -- at providing detailed articles on various technical and social aspects, real-time updates, and impressive interactive animations like this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/03/12/world/asia/the-explosion-at-the-japanese-reactor.html?ref=asia">one describing spent fuel pools</a>.</p>
<p>I say "worriedly" with respect to how alarming some of the messages were - the European Commission likened the situation to an "Apocalypse", other sources claimed <a href="http://www.francesoir.fr/actualite/international/fukushima-pire-que-tchernobyl-82420.html">"Worse than Chrenobyl" ,</a>... which we all knew was not the case - but -&nbsp; to be fair, even last Tuesday and Wednesday, it was uneasy to grasp that the situation was getting worse instead of better.</p>
<p>And through all this coverage, I think many of us felt that there was quite a lot of unclear and mixed messages about radiation and doses and limits and contamination ...</p>
<p>So yea, as the title of this post suggests, I just wanted to share <strong><a href="http://xkcd.com/radiation/">this chart</a></strong> made by the guy who writes xkcd comics that I think does a pretty good job of putting radiation doses in perspective.</p>
<p>Here's a small glimpse of the chart to give you an idea of what it looks like: <a href="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/radiation.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-41" title="radiation" src="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/radiation.png" alt="" width="393" height="241" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And FYI, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_50">"Fukushima 50" </a>, the workers that received the highest radiation doses received a maximum of 250mSv (this limit was extended by the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry in light of the situation, from a prior absolute maximum of 100mSv per year).</p>
