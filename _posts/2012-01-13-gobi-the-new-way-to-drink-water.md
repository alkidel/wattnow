<p style="text-align: justify;">Based in Paris, France, <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/">Gobilab</a> has recently commercialized the <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/decouvrez-le-gobi/design/">Gobi</a>, an ergonomic, eco-friendly, &nbsp;and beautifully-designed water bottle. &nbsp;And above all, Made In France.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.gobilab.com/"> <img class="alignnone" title="gobiLAB - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/gobiLAB-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="640" height="102" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's interesting as an American living in Paris to read about this "new way to drink water", when in the US, people have been toting around reusable water bottles, including the <a href="http://nalgene.com/">Nalgene</a> (classic), <a href="http://www.sigg.com/">Sigg</a>&nbsp;(hip and durable), and more recently, innovative designs like <a href="http://vapur.us/">Vapur</a>'s foldable "Anti-Bottle", for decades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But it's true that in France, people do not carry reusable water bottles. &nbsp;But they drink a LOT of water. &nbsp;So Gobilab's got the right idea in assuming that they can make a huge impact with the Gobi concept. &nbsp;And that is the primary goal - in accordance with the <a href="http://www2.ademe.fr/servlet/getDoc?id=11433&amp;m=3&amp;cid=96">Ademe</a>'s (an environmental and energy agency) waste reduction policy - to <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/pourquoi-comment/developpement-durable/">eliminate the use of disposable cups and plastic water bottles</a>.</p>

<dd class="wp-caption-dd">The Gobi water bottle.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The design of the Gobi underwent an <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/pourquoi-comment/developpement-durable/">eco-conception program</a> that lasted months, to evaluate the environmental impacts of the lifecycle of the product, including all facets from fabrication to packaging. &nbsp;Moreover, the Gobi team worked with a sociologist to understand people's water-drinking habits, to design a reusable water bottle that is <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/pourquoi-comment/pourquoi-reinventer-la-bouteille/">practical for the masses</a> - not just for "hikers and athletes".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The result: A sleek water bottle that is:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Transparent - it is important for users to see the water and assure the pureness of the water</li>
<li>Portable - the bottle weighs less than 100g and the height is capped at 21cm, allowing for an ultra lightweight design that can easily attach to a bag or a backpack and can carry 40cl of water, the average consumption for the morning or the afternoon</li>
<li>Customizable - the bottle comes in 5 different colors and has a patented tag system in which you can easily insert a label or a photo. &nbsp;Check out this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gobilab/sets/72157625892941349/">gallery of personalized Gobis on Flickr</a></li>
<li>Eco-friendly - the Gobi is made from <a href="http://www.eastman.com/brands/eastman_tritan/Pages/Overview.aspx">Tritan</a>, a new material that is reusable, durable, and does not emit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A ">BPAs</a>. &nbsp;Moreover, the Gobi is <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/2011/05/made-in-france/">manufactured in France</a>, not only reducing the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process, but also creating a closer relationship with suppliers, allowing high quality and safety measures.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.gobilab.com/2011/05/made-in-france/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1511 " title="gobi - made in france" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/gobi-made-in-france.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="408" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's more - Gobilab is going one step beyond product retail to create a community among Gobi users called <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/la-communaute-gobi/les-utilisateurs/">BeGobi</a>. &nbsp;AND, Gobilab is creating <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/la-communaute-gobi/le-reseau/">Eaupen</a> (pronounced "Open"), a map of free water sources (public fountains, participating cafes and restaurants, etc.) around France. &nbsp;Gobilab spends 20% of their time developing this Gobi network, emphasizing the importance they put on a <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/pourquoi-comment/developpement-durable/">holistic Gobi approach</a>&nbsp;in order to create a complete and relevant solution to reducing disposable waste associated with drinking water.</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right now, the Gobi is available for specifically for the French market (and as it's the season of the "soldes", or sales, the they're offering <a href="http://boutique.gobilab.com/">20% off, and 30% if you advertise for them on Facebook</a>!). &nbsp;I'm curious if and how they plan to expand outside of France - given the locally designed and fabricated business model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another aspect I'm curious about is how French startups like Gobilab get started initially - especially from a financial standpoint. &nbsp;It seems that compared to the American system, venture capital support is much less of a "thing" in Europe (as I mentioned in the <a title="SkySails.  New energy for shipping." href="http://wattnow.org/1480/skysails-new-energy-for-shipping">article about SkySails</a>). &nbsp;This being said, the startup culture is vibrant - I attended a Paris Hackers meetup yesterday at <a href="http://joshfire.com/">Joshfire</a>&nbsp;and was pleasantly surprised by the number of enthusiastic entrepreneurs I met. It seems that a lot more financial support in Europe comes from government agencies and angel funding. &nbsp;Gobilab for instance, <a href="http://www.gobilab.com/pourquoi-comment/developpement-durable/">received support from Ademe</a>, specifically on their eco-conception product development program. &nbsp;I'll keep looking into this. &nbsp;And feel free to elaborate or disagree!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In any case, I'm excited to order my new Gobi. &nbsp;And one for my boyfriend. &nbsp;And one for his friend. &nbsp;Let's go BeGobi!</p>
