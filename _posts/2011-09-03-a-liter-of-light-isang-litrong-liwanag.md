<p style="text-align: justify;">Recipe: Solar Bottle Bulb (55-60W)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ingredients: Used plastic bottle (50cl-1l), water, bleach, a sheet of currogated iron.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instructions: 1) Open the bottle, fill it with water and a pinch of bleach. 2) Cut a small hole in the metallic roof of an unlit home, just wide enough for the bottle to fit. &nbsp;3) Line and seal the bottle with currogated iron to prevent leakage. &nbsp;4) Insert bottle in hole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Preparation time / cost: 1 hour. &nbsp;$1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Servings: 5 years of light &nbsp;(55-60W)&nbsp;widely spread through an unlit room.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/slider-01b.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-331 alignnone" title="slider-01b" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/slider-01b.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="680" height="440" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meet the "solar bottle bulb". &nbsp;The simplest lightbulb ever. &nbsp;Originally invented at MIT's D-Lab and now adapted and widely distributed to thousands in the Philippines by the <a href="http://isanglitrongliwanag.org/about-us/">MyShelter Foundation</a>, an organization started by Illac Diaz spreading the&nbsp;<a href="http://isanglitrongliwanag.org/">Isang Litrong Liwanag</a>&nbsp;(A Liter of Light) project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You're probably thinking, what's so great about a lightbulb that provides light during the day??? &nbsp;Well, a lot of homes do not have windows for leakage reasons and depend instead on expensive electricity or kerosene to light their houses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magic of the water bottle bulb as compared to just a hole in the ceiling is - refraction. &nbsp;Where a simple hole in the ceiling will allow sunlight to travel in a straight line and concentrate to a specific spot, the water in the water bulb will refract and disperse the sun's rays in all directions in order to illuminate the whole room. &nbsp;It's cheap. &nbsp;It's durable. &nbsp;It's safer than candles or kerosene or electric wiring. &nbsp;It's effective.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MyShelter Foundation aims to provide 1 million homes with light by 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">See this video for a better idea of the project:&nbsp;<a href=""Bringing light to the poor, one liter at a time"">"Bringing light to the poor, one liter at a time"</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The water light bulb takes the word "simple" to a whole new level. &nbsp;I'm beaming.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks Charlie!</p>
