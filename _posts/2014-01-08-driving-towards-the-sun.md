<p>Did you hear?</p>
<p>Ford revealed its new Ford C-Max Solar Energi <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/environment/2014/01/ford-c-max-solar-energi-concept-car-coming-to-ces-2014-2489108.html">concept car</a> at CES 2014 ; a car equipped with 300W of semi-flexible rooftop solar (Sunpower) that can run quasi-entirely on solar charging without need to draw energy from the electric grid.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="C-MAX Solar Energi back" src="http://i2.wp.com/cleantechnica.com/files/2014/01/C-MAX-Solar-Energi-back.jpg?fit=570%2C1200" width="500" height="294" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The innovation in the system lies not only in the high-efficiency solar panels but also a unique charging station composed of solar concentrator and sun-tracking technology that allows to charge the car's battery in one day (as opposed to one week if the solar panels worked alone!).</p>

<p>The canopy structure contains Fresnal lenses to &nbsp;concentrate the sun's energy on the panels, and moreover, the car is actually programmed to inch backward and forward to track the sun throughout the day!</p>
<p>For the moment, the C-Max Solar Energi remains a "concept car" (clocking in a mere 21 electric-only miles per charge), but hopefully the project will kick other car companies into gear for other exciting solar-powered transport innovations.</p>
