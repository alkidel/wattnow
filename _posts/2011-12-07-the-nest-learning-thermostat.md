<p><a href="http://www.nest.com/index.html">Nest Labs</a>, based in Palo Alto, CA, designed <a href="http://www.nest.com/inside-and-out/index.html">The Nest Learning Thermostat</a>, a simple and intelligent thermostat that programs itself in one week to keep you comfy and save a lot of energy (and money).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nest.com/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1026" title="nest thermostat" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/nest-thermostat-300x296.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="296" /></a></p>
<p>Almost looks like an Apple product, right? &nbsp;Not surprising since the two co-founders, <a href="http://www.nest.com/about/index.html">Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers</a>, both helped develop and design many generations of the iPod and iPhone.</p>
<p>The Nest Learning Thermostat is different from other digital thermostats in that,</p>
<ul>
<li>it is simple (according to one study, <a href="http://www.nest.com/why-we-made-it/index.html">90% of programmable thermostats</a> are rarely or never programmed since they're so complicated to operate),</li>
<li>it continues to "learn" and improve efficiency using a combination of sensors and algorithms,</li>
<li>it connects to WiFi to integrate current weather conditions in understanding energy use,</li>
<li>&nbsp;it is easily controllable remotely using your computer or smartphone, and finally,</li>
<li>it just looks awesome.</li>
</ul>
<p>"We&rsquo;ve built the world&rsquo;s first learning thermostat &mdash; a thermostat for the iPhone generation," <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/technology/at-nest-labs-ex-apple-leaders-remake-the-thermostat.html?pagewanted=all">Mr. Fadell said.</a></p>
<p>Why so much excitement about a thermostat? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.nest.com/why-we-made-it/index.html">As Nest puts it</a>, "We didn't think thermostats mattered either... until we learned <strong>they control about 50% of our energy bill</strong>".</p>
<p>So true! &nbsp;Check out <a title="turn off that radiator !" href="http://wattnow.org/84/turn-off-that-radiator">this article I wrote</a> about learning the hard way about the impact of heating/cooling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nest.com/why-we-made-it/index.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-1028" title="nest - home electricity distribution" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/nest-home-electricity-distribution1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="879" height="326" /></a></p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/nest-leaf.png' | relative_url }}"><br />
</a></p>
<p>The Nest "leaf" <a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/nest-leaf.png' | relative_url }}"><img title="nest leaf" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/nest-leaf.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="35" height="56" /></a>&nbsp;appears on your thermostat when you are saving energy -- and changing the temperature just one degree can cut your energy use by up to 5%.</p>
<p>Though the Nest has a steeper price tag than other thermostats ($249), the savings are immediate and you'll have a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nest.com/living-with-nest/index.html">payback period of 1-2 years</a>.</p>
<p>But no use in trying to snag a Nest for this Christmas, since they've already sold out for 2011. &nbsp;But you can still put your name in to <a href="http://store.nest.com/">order a Nest for early 2012</a>.</p>
