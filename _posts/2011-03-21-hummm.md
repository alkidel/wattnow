<p style="text-align: justify;">To kickoff <strong>Watt Now</strong>, I will start with the project <a href="http://www.humdingerwind.com/"><strong>Humdinger</strong>.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/humdinger-logo.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5" title="humdinger logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/humdinger-logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="197" height="66" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A simple and elegant concept based on "aerolastic flutter", that harnesses energy from the wind (by creating a flutter oscillation on a tensioned membrane) and converts the flutter to electricity through new types of linear generators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/humding2.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-8 aligncenter" title="humding" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/humding2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="909" height="319" /></a><br />
The <a href="http://www.humdingerwind.com/">Humdinger technology</a> can respond to different level of power needs, including the "micro energy" market. &nbsp;In other words, a "micro Humdinger" can generate "micro energy" for devices that require very small amounts of power, such as wireless sensor nodes for example in "Smart Buildings" which require a large number of low-powered sensors.&nbsp; Humdinger&rsquo;s "microBelt" provides robust, clean, cheap, and sustainable replacement to batteries if placed next to natural wind flows (i.e. vents of a building).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you Jordan (one of the founders) for enlightening me to this cool tool.</p>
