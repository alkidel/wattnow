<p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/organics/food/fd-basic.htm">Organic waste makes up 14% of total waste</a> generated in the US. &nbsp;What if we could convert all that waste into something valuable - for instance, electricity, fuel, and fertilizer products - with <strong>0% waste left</strong> in the end? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.harvestpower.com/">Harvest Power</a>, recently&nbsp;voted one of the <a href="http://www.cleantech.com/global-cleantech-100/">Global Cleantech 100</a>,&nbsp;does just that.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/Harvest.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-474" title="Harvest" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/Harvest.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="302" height="125" /></a></p>

<p>To simplify, Harvest Power's industrial-scale process consists of two majors steps: anaerobic digestion and advanced composting. &nbsp;The anaerobic digesters extract methane from the organic waste. &nbsp;This <a href="http://www.harvestpower.com/products/renewable-energy/">biogas</a> is then processed to either produce electricity (by fueling a combined heat and power -CHP- unit), heating, and/or transportation fuel (by processing the biogas into compressed natural gas, CNG).</p>
<p>Just a bit of energy101 to understand why it's better for the environment to use organic waste as fuel than let it go to the landfill: On one hand, if the organic waste is left alone and sent to the landfill, methane from the waste is released into the atmosphere. &nbsp;Methane is a greenhouse gas that is <a href="http://PARKSPARKPROJECT.COM/artwork/1110360.html">30-70x more potent than CO2 </a>as a harmful greenhouse gas. &nbsp;On the other hand, anaerobic digestion allows to extract the methane and burn it as fuel. &nbsp;Of course, the combustion of methane will still release CO2 into the air, but it will be much less harmful than directly released methane.</p>
<p>After the anaerobic digestion, the remaining organic solids are aerobically composted using Harvest's proprietary <a href="http://www.harvestpower.com/capabilities/technology/composting/">Covered Aerated Static Pile</a> system and processed into <a href="http://www.harvestpower.com/products/soil-products/">high quality soil, mulch, and organic fertilizers</a>.</p>

<p>Advantages of Harvest's model? &nbsp;Reduce landfill needs (which I'm learning can be extremely costly), provide a much cleaner solution for the waste (by burning the methane instead of direct release), AND create value out of waste (electricity, fuel, and fertilizers!).</p>
<p>Totally awesome. &nbsp;I'm a tad bit concerned about the fact that the facilities are centralized and the waste and fuel must be distributed - potentially over long distances - and distribution can sometimes be the pitfall of a technology. &nbsp;But I trust that Harvest is working that out.</p>
<p>If you couldn't tell, I'm a huge fan of converting organic waste into energy. &nbsp;Check out <a title="Sanergy. Building Sustainable Sanitation in Urban Slums." href="http://wattnow.org/254/sanergy-building-sustainable-sanitation-in-urban-slums">Sanergy</a>, <a title="The Power of Dog Poop" href="http://wattnow.org/79/the-power-of-dog-poop">The Park Spark Project</a>, and <a title="Purpose Energy, Inc." href="http://wattnow.org/27/purpose-energy-inc">Purpose Energy</a>&nbsp;for other cool projects with the organic waste/scat=>fuel principle.</p>
