<p style="text-align: justify;">If you travel or move around a lot with your laptop computer, I bet you often find yourself thinking twice about bringing your charger with you ... because it's just so cumbersome. &nbsp;However, the end is near for clunky power supplies&nbsp;- thanks to<a href="http://www.onchippower.com/"> OnChip Power</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/onchip.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-467 alignnone" title="onchip" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/onchip.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="302" height="65" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OnChip Power is an MIT spinoff that is working to significantly reduce the size of power supply systems from "brick" to "quarter".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology is based on an innovative VHF switching architecture and in February 2011, OnChip received<a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2011/02/onchip_power_aiming_a_shrink_r.html"> $1.8 million in venture backing</a>. Wow!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OnChip is focusing on LED bulbs to start - but eventually envisions moving towards power supplies for laptops, printers, and mobile phones - ya know, that are&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/onchip-power">10x smaller and 20x better</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They were working out of the <a href="http://dogpatchlabs.com/">Dogpatch Labs</a>, a community working space for new startups - but they might have moved out to a bigger space as they were planning to hire more engineers and build an electronics lab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to sign off prematurely - because I opted not to lug my "brick" charger with me today and now I'm running low on battery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Go figure.</p>
