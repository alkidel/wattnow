<p><a href="https://gbrecycle.com/">Greenbean Recycle</a>, located in Somerville, MA, creates physical networks of "recycling machines" for individuals/teams to make money and compete while recycling!</p>
<p><a href="https://gbrecycle.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1048" title="greenbean_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/greenbean_logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="228" height="89" /></a></p>
<p>A Greenbean machine is a <a href="https://gbrecycle.com/faq#q1">reverse vending machine</a> (RVM) often seen in grocery stores to deposit bottles and cans.</p>
<div class="mceTemp" >
<dl id="attachment_1049" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 308px;">
<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/greenbean-stratton.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-1049" title="greenbean - zoe" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/greenbean-zoe.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="298" height="397" /></a></dt>

<p>The Greenbean machine differs from traditional RVMs in that it:</p>
<ul >
<li>Makes a direct payment for refund bottles either via Paypal, your school ID cash card or to a charity (you decide when you <a href="https://gbrecycle.com/">register online</a>)</li>
<li>Gives you real-time data of the energy benefit of recycling the containers instead of tossing them in the trash (using EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/tools/iwarm/">Individual Waste Reduction Model - iWARM</a>)</li>
<li>Tells you how you (or your team) is performing as compared to your community (Greenbean creates "challenges" within and eventually among networks to instill friendly competition).</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the Greenbean machine intelligently separates glass, plastics, and aluminum, which are then sent directly to baling facilities - eliminating the need to send materials to sorting facilities and the energy needed to sort the materials. &nbsp;And the machine notifies the facilities when the bin is full to avoid&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;pickup. &nbsp;Like <a href="http://bigbellysolar.com/">BigBelly Solar</a>. &nbsp;In fact, BigBelly Solar is one of their advisors. &nbsp;Nice partnership!</p>
<p>Currently, Greenbean has launched their RVM system at MIT, and will soon expand to Tufts and other universities, and eventually plans to expand to stadiums, airports, festivals - anywhere with high density of recyclable materials.</p>
<p>I made an account for the MIT network and here's a look at who's recycling at MIT:</p>

<p>Fraternities are leading the way on recycling?!? &nbsp;Wow!</p>
<p>The Greenbean model is another interesting use of gamification to motivate people to recycle and/or be more energy efficient- like <a title="Recyclebank.  Be green.  And get rewarded for it." href="http://wattnow.org/787/recyclebank-learn-about-green-living-and-get-rewarded-for-it">RecycleBank</a>, <a title="Simple Energy.  Making saving energy social, fun and simple." href="http://wattnow.org/1037/simple-energy-making-saving-energy-social-fun-and-simple">Simple Energy</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Opower.  A new experience for utility customers." href="http://wattnow.org/772/opower-a-new-experience-for-utility-customers">Opower</a>. &nbsp;But this model focuses on physical networks and targeting&nbsp;networks with pre-existing strong communities (re. universities). &nbsp;Awesome.</p>
