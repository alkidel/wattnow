<p><a href="http://firstfuel.com/">FirstFuel</a>'s "zero-touch" software provides an extremely fast and simple approach to energy efficiency for commercial buildings.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/first-fuel.png' | relative_url }}"><img title="first-fuel" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/first-fuel.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="228" height="37" /></a></p>
<p>What do we mean by "zero-touch"?</p>
<p>FirstFuel's<a href="http://firstfuel.com/home/how_it_works">&nbsp;<em>Rapid Building Assessment (RBA) Platform</em></a>&nbsp;is remote and automated - no need for audits, devices, or connections. &nbsp;Instead, FirstFuel requires two simple inputs:</p>
<p>1) One year of the building's energy consumption data (easily provided by the utility) and</p>
<p>2) The building's address - which quickly identifies local weather data and GIS data.</p>
<p>With these two inputs, FirstFuel's super sophisticated patent-pending analytical engine will process the data to provide a comprehensive building analysis and customized operational and retrofit recommendations. &nbsp;Moreover, FirstFuel's RBA platform provides monitoring tools to track energy savings over time.</p>
<p>It's fast. &nbsp;And cheap.</p>
<p>But... are you losing quality by replacing a detailed onsite audit by a remote analysis? &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;In fact, not at all.</p>
<p>Both Fraunhofer and Cadmus Institutes have audited FirstFuel's systems and found the results to be within 2-10% of meter values -- ya know, at a fraction of the time and cost.</p>
<p>Moreover, the FirstFuel system has had tremendous success with its pilot case in Lexington, MA. &nbsp;Lexington used FirstFuel's RBAs on five of the largest energy consuming buildings, and the analysis and results have<a href="http://firstfuel.com/casestudy/FirstFuel-MunicipalPortfolioCaseStudy-110922.pdf">&nbsp;delivered 7% operational savings</a>&nbsp;- without any investments necessary.</p>
<p>I don't know much about smart buildings and energy efficiency - but it seems that FirstFuel's remote and simulating approach is quite revolutionary and could shake things up. &nbsp;It doesn't hurt that they recently received $2.4 million in initial funding from Battery Ventures and Nth Power.</p>
