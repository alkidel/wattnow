<p><a href="http://www.novomer.com/?action=main">Novomer</a>&nbsp;converts waste CO2 and CO into valuable plastics. &nbsp;Pretty awesome, right?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.novomer.com/?action=main"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-800" title="novomer" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/novomer.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="305" height="91" /></a></p>

<p>To break it down, plastics are simply polymers of carbon and hydrogen. &nbsp;Traditionally, they are manufactured <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/plastic5.htm">almost entirely from fossil fuels</a>, which is probably something we don't think about.</p>
<p>In contrast, Novomer's innovative technology combines traditional feedstock with up to <a href="http://www.novomer.com/?action=tech_overview">50% of waste CO2 and CO</a> and uses propriety catalysts to produce high-performance plastics used for packaging, coatings, electronics, and more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.novomer.com/?action=tech_overview"><img title="novomer process" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/novomer-process.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="582" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>What's the big deal? &nbsp;Let's consider three important criteria for comparing plastics technologies: sustainability, cost, and performance.</p>
<p>1. Traditional plastics&nbsp;are cheap and have high performance, but -- are made from fossil fuels (ie. not sustainable).</p>
<p>2. There's a new type of plastics emerging from bio-based polymers, made from sustainable feedstock like corn, but these plastics are expensive and lack performance required for many applications.</p>
<p>3. Novomer's CO2-based plastics are <a href="http://www.novomer.com/?action=tech_value_prop">competitive, have high-performance</a>, and best of all, are made from up to 50% CO2 and CO. &nbsp;Not only does this mean that Novomer uses 50% less fossil fuels in the mix, but their innovative products also <a href="http://www.novomer.com/?action=environment_CO2">"sequester" CO2</a>&nbsp;during the life of the product. &nbsp;It's a two-way benefit in terms of sustainability!</p>
<p>We also saw this innovative idea of converting waste CO2 into a valuable product with <a href="http://wattnow.org/516/joule-unlimited-liquid-fuel-from-the-sun">Joule Unlimited </a>which converts waste CO2 into ethanol and diesel fuels. &nbsp;As Novomer explains, while the quantities of CO2 are small compared to the amount of CO2 released on a global scale, technologies like Novomer's and Joule's could serve as a <a href="http://www.novomer.com/?action=environment_CO2">stepping stone to large scales</a>.</p>
<p>Novomer has won numerous awards and was recently recognized as one of the <a href="http://www.cleantech.com/global-cleantech-100/">2011 Global Cleantech 100</a>. &nbsp;Right on!</p>
<p>Just a sidenote: the Global Cleantech 100 list is great for learning about awesome cleantech companies, including many I've written about such as&nbsp;<a title="1366 Technologies.  Solar manufacturing for the 21st century." href="http://wattnow.org/704/1366-technologies-solar-manufacturing-for-the-21st-century">1366</a>, <a title="Opower.
