<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.generalcompression.com/">General Compression</a> is a Newton, MA-based company that has developed a energy system that makes available "dispatachable wind" in order to face the challenge of intermittency that wind and many renewable energy sources face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/GC.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-380 alignnone" title="GC" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/GC.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="204" height="60" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They have developed the General Compression Advanced Energy Storage (CGAES) system that takes electricity produced by wind turbines and stores that energy in the form of high-pressure air underground in geological formations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2009, General Compression received a $750,000 grant from the DOE's <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov/">Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)</a> agency, a funding entity dedicated to creative transformational energy research.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Check out <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov/Media/News/tabid/83/vw/1/ItemID/26/Default.aspx">this article </a>about ARPA-E projects that have attracted private investors. &nbsp;Notice how 5 out of the 6 companies are Massachusetts-based. &nbsp;Not bad!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">General Compression also recently received $54.5 million from private investors (wow!) and will launch a pilot project in Texas in partnership with ConocoPhilipps, US Renewables Group, Duke Energy, and Serious Change. &nbsp;The pilot will start at 2MW, scalable up to 1,000MW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Energy storage systems. &nbsp;Hm, I haven't written very much about them. &nbsp;Mainly because I haven't read that much about them. &nbsp;And clearly, for renewable sources, it is <strong>the</strong>&nbsp;major technical roadblock in integrating them into the Grid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This sort of technology could definitely shift the paradigm.</p>
