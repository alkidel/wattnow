  content: I thought it was over the top when my dad washes the recyclables, but now
    I see why he does it! I always rinse mine, and will definitely pay more attention
    to what I recycle.

<p>So I'm pretty interested in learning about recycling. &nbsp;Partly because I work in the recycling business. &nbsp;Nuclear fuel recycling. &nbsp;(maybe not what you first had in mind). &nbsp;And I'm slowly realizing that recycling consumer goods (paper, plastics, electronics, ...) is complicated. &nbsp;Maybe not as complicated as recycling nuclear fuel, but still, as I started to discuss in <a title="plastic bags are not recyclable!" href="http://alki.delichatsios.com/?p=55">this post on recycling plastics</a>, I think most people are not well-informed of WHAT you can and can not recycle. &nbsp;And moreover, you may have really good intentions, but it's also important HOW you recycle too, because if you throw everything in the recycling bin (ahem, like I used to), and there's a greasy container, or some juice left in that carton, that whole "lot" of recycled goods, might have to end up in the trash.</p>
<p>When you are out of a "school system", what is an effective way to communicate to communities about things like recycling "dos" and "don'ts"???</p>
<p>Moral of the story - recycling is obviously great - but it's complicated and not very effective unless you do it correctly - so get to know the norms in your neighborhood. &nbsp;And better yet -- what's even better than recycling, -- wait for it -- is reducing and reusing. &nbsp;Yes, some of those things we learned when we're young, like the quadratic formula, stick with us forever.</p>
<p>Reduce. &nbsp;Reuse. &nbsp;And then - Recycle.</p>
