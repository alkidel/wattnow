<p>Like 1BOG and the <a title="Qurrent.  The community energy company." href="http://wattnow.org/235/qurrent-the-community-energy-company">Qurrent</a> concept, <a href="http://solarmosaic.com/">Solar Mosaic </a>is another great example of <strong>energy 2.0</strong> - in other words, rendering renewable energy accessible and collaborative.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/06/mosaic.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-248 alignnone" title="mosaic" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/06/mosaic.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="260" height="65" /></a></p>
<p>Solar Mosaic provides individuals the opportunity to contribute to the construction of a solar project by investing in one or more "tiles" that make up a solar "mosaic" for as little as $100. &nbsp; By investing in the mosaic, the individual contributes to the transition to clean energy and helps create local green jobs AND ... he or she will be paid back 100%&nbsp;through the revenue that the tile generates.&nbsp; After all tile purchasers are paid back, revenue is then directed to fund other community solar projects.</p>
<p>Solar Mosaic is a clear demonstration of bottom-up opportunity for developing distributed renewable power.</p>
