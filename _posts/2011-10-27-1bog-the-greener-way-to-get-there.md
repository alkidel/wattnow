<p>Every wednesday, <a href="http://1bog.org/blog/">One Block Off the Grid</a>&nbsp;publishes an awesome infographic about energy.</p>
<p>I thought <a href="http://1bog.org/blog/infographic-the-greener-way-to-get-there/">this infographic on traveling and the greenest way to get somewhere</a>&nbsp;in terms of pounds of CO2 emitted per trip&nbsp;- car, bus, train, or airplane - was particularly informative.</p>
<p>I am however, a bit confused about the emissions associated with taking a plane. &nbsp;They seem very low -- to go across the country from NYC to Los Angeles, flying is less pollutant than taking a train?</p>
<p>I always thought flying was by far the least green way of getting somewhere. &nbsp;<a href="http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tech-transport/plane-train-automobile-travel.html">This article</a>&nbsp;does a similar transport comparison with results which are pretty consistent with the infographic - except for the airplane emissions (the article says ~2,500 lbs CO2 from NYC to San Francisco). &nbsp;Any thoughts? &nbsp;Maybe I'll contact 1BOG about this.</p>
