<p style="text-align: justify;">Auckland, New Zealand-based&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/">LanzaTech</a>&nbsp;converts waste carbon monoxide (from steel mills, oil refineries, chemical plants, etc) into ethanol and high-value chemicals using proprietary gas fermentation microbes. &nbsp;A two-fold miracle worker - 1. creating value out of waste, and 2. reducing co2 emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1566" title="lanzatech - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/lanzatech-logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="412" height="51" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The LanzaTech process centers around its patented, wholly-owned microbe, categorized as a<a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/content/synthetic-biology-high-value-chemicals"> WHO-risk 1 organism (same as baker's yeast)</a>. &nbsp;Through a fermentation process, the microbe acts as a biocatalyst to break down industrial waste gases into ethanol and eventually other fuels and chemicals, including <a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/content/synthetic-biology-high-value-chemicals">diesel, jet fuel, and plastics</a>. &nbsp;Check out <a href="http://vimeo.com/32805852">this video</a>&nbsp;for a more-detailed explanation of the LanzaTech process.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I'll admit - a small part of LanzaTech's attraction is its Kiwi roots (though they have expanded their offices to China and the US) and a strong female leader at its head, <a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/content/executive-team">Jennifer Holmgren</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond these rarities, LanzaTech, along with other startups like <a title="Joule Unlimited.  Liquid fuel from the sun." href="http://wattnow.org/516/joule-unlimited-liquid-fuel-from-the-sun">Joule Unlimited</a> and <a title="Novomer.  Catalyzing green chemistry." href="http://wattnow.org/799/novomer-catalyzing-green-chemistry">Novomer</a>, is making headlines by moving quickly and strategically towards a clean, economic, and industrial-scale waste-to-energy solution. &nbsp;Lanzatech launched a pilot plant in 2008 at the BlueScope Steel Mill in New Zealand, successfully demonstrating the <a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/content/lanzatech-process">LanzaTech process</a> and plans a full-scale commercial facility in 2012, and the <a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/sites/default/files/imce_uploads/lanzatech_brochure_0.pdf">world's first steel waste gas to ethanol plant in 2013</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LanzaTech, backed by Khosla Ventures, has also <a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/content/partnerships">secured strategic industrial partnerships</a> to guarantee a robust full-scale expansion. &nbsp;For example, they've partnered with Chinese steel manufacturer giants, like China's #1 BaoSteel Group Corp, to build plants at steel mills, as well as the US Department of Energy on making jet fuel. &nbsp;Ya know, just a couple "small" partnerships to name a few. Clearly, not only does LanzaTech possess a brilliant technology, but they know how to leverage the technology in today's international market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LanzaTech was founded in 2005&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lanzatech.co.nz/content/who-we-are">with a goal</a>&nbsp;"to develop and commercialize proprietary technologies for the production of low-carbon fuels that do not compromise food or land resources". &nbsp;Today, that goal is about to be realized.</p>
