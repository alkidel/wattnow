<p style="text-align: justify;">The world's off-grid population - who are also the world's poorest - not only rely on dirty and unsafe sources for their energy needs (kerosene for lighting, charcoal for cooking), but they are also paying a much higher price for energy needs than their grid-connected counterparts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We've seen a number of off-grid projects respond to this energy economics paradox, such as <a href="http://wattnow.org/686/egg-energy-building-the-portable-grid">EGG-Energy</a>, <a href="http://wattnow.org/418/simpa-networks-radical-affordability">Simpa Networks</a>, <a href="http://www.earthsparkinternational.org/index.html">EarthSpark International</a>, and now we're seeing something in between no-grid and grid:&nbsp;<strong>the microgrid.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://meragaopower.com/">Mera Gao Micro Grid Power</a>&nbsp;</strong>is a "micro-lighting utility" , installing local grid systems in Uttar Pradesh, an Indian region close to the Nepalese border.</p>
<p><a href="http://meragaopower.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2293" title="meragao_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/07/meragao_logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="940" height="150" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;The <a href="http://meragaopower.com/?page_id=10">MGP system</a> simply consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>four solar panels, enough to power 100 households, which are mounted onto a household,</li>
<li>a battery bank to provide 2-days worth of electricity,</li>
<li>a low-voltage power distribution network,</li>
<li>LED lamps for households.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://meragaopower.com/?page_id=10"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2289" title="meragao_system" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/07/meragao_system.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="698" height="147" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The microgrid may not be as efficient per kwh as a traditional grid system, but the MGP microgrid is a low-investment, quick-to-market solution that can eventually be scaled and interconnected.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mera Gao (meaning "My Village" in Hindi) is constantly and cleverly optimizing their microgrid design to reduce costs and provide a robust system. &nbsp;For instance, the system runs at low-voltage (24V), allowing to <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/article/427670/solar-microgrids/">use aluminum wiring</a>, rather than expensive copper wiring which is needed for high-voltage transmission (and which also leads to copper theft). &nbsp;Another design feature to be included is that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/article/427670/solar-microgrids/">circuit breakers will trip</a> if someone tries to steal electricity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mera Gao MGP provides the capital investment of the system,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/article/427670/solar-microgrids/">which is about $2500</a>. &nbsp;In return, the customers of the community sign up and pay a small initiation fee and receive 2-4 LED lamps, followed by a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/article/427670/solar-microgrids/">monthly "subscription" of 100 rupees ($2)</a>. &nbsp;This fee covers .2 amps for 7 hours per night, enough to power two LED lights and a mobile charger. &nbsp;Normally, a household will pay 100-150 rupees for these services, so the economic transition payoff is immediate for the customer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://meragaopower.com/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2291" title="meragao_panels" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/07/meragao_panels.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="460" height="280" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lack of investment is extremely important for adoption of the system - we've seen that with retail models selling individual solar lamps and systems, the <a href="http://wattnow.org/418/simpa-networks-radical-affordability">upfront cost is often a huge barrier</a>&nbsp;for customers to make the transition from kerosene to solar, even if the breakeven point comes after just a couple months. &nbsp;This challenge has led to many creative lending and rent-to-own business models as seen with <a title="Eight19.  Transforming lives with flexible solar technology." href="http://wattnow.org/2246/eight19-transforming-lives-with-flexible-solar-technology">Eight19</a> and <a title="Simpa Networks.  Radical Affordability." href="http://wattnow.org/418/simpa-networks-radical-affordability">Simpa Networks</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<a href="http://meragaopower.com/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2292" title="meragao_temple" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/07/meragao_temple.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="480" height="280" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mera Gao MGP is a for-profit social enterprise, striving for a 15% minimum return on investment (ROI) for investors. &nbsp; With MGP's model, returns start coming in after about a year and half, making it a win-win situation for all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since last summer, Mera Gao has installed systems in 9 villages and hopes to <a href="http://simpanetworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Affordable-offgrid-solar_pvi_1206.pdf">reach another 70 villages</a> (providing electricity for 3,000 customers) by the end of this year!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The microgrid is undoubtedly a promising solution for communities lacking basic energy needs - but as the Rocky Mountain Institute perscribes, could the <a href="http://www.rmi.org/nations_largest_microgrid_online_esj_article">microgrid also be the necessary foundation</a> for a more intelligent, electrified, efficient energy system of the future for us all?</p>
