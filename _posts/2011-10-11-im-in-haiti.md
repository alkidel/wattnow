<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I'm in Haiti for two weeks until October 24 with <a href="http://www.earthsparkinternational.org/">EarthSpark International&nbsp;</a>to work on expanding their clean energy supply chain solutions. &nbsp;Check out what I <a title="EarthSpark International" href="http://wattnow.org/118/earthspark-international">wrote about this awesome organization</a> a while back.</p>
<p>I will have little/ no access to internet, so I won't be able to write on my ~1x/day frequency. &nbsp;But I'll do my best! &nbsp;In the meantime, this is a perfect opportunity to catch up on all the articles that you haven't been able to read! &nbsp;:-)</p>
