<p>Belgium-based <strong><a href="http://wewatt.be/index.html">WeWatt</a></strong> is developing the <strong>WeBike</strong>, a pedal-powered table that generates electricity for devices such as laptops and cell phones -- to be installed in offices, restaurants, or even at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://wewatt.be/index.html"><img title="WeBike_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/WeBike_logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="259" height="108" /></a></p>
<p>Human power is not an efficient means for generating electricity.&nbsp; But the WeBike is not solely about generating electricity.&nbsp; The objective of the WeBike&nbsp;is to combine&nbsp;<a href="http://wewatt.be/gentle_exercise.html">"gentle exercise"</a> (which has been shown to <a href="http://wewatt.be/productivity.html">increase productivity</a>) with sustainability and smart energy.</p>
<p><a href="http://wewatt.be/index.html"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2147" title="webike_office" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/webike_office1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="448" height="210" /></a></p>
<p>If you work in an office environment, you probably spend a lot of time idle in front of a computer screen.&nbsp; The WeBike offers a relaxed sweat-free opportunity to exercise "gently" at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;And while you're at it, charge your computer at the same time!&nbsp; Each seat generates about <a href="http://wewatt.be/specifications.html">30W of power </a>&nbsp;and has a LED display indicating available AC power.</p>

<p>The WeBike also embodies sustainable design, using for example waste leather for the seat, waste cedar for the structure, and all concept, design, and manufacturing done locally in Flanders.&nbsp; Moreover, the pedal-table is made from 30 different components that have been carefully designed to meet <a href="http://www.ovam.be/jahia/Jahia/pid/1219?lang=null">Ovam ecological guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>We've already documented the pedal-to-power concept as applied to a gym setting with <a title="The Green Revolution, Inc." href="http://wattnow.org/324/the-green-revolution-inc">Green Revolution</a>, and my "energy net-zero" creperie dream definitely envisioned a similar "bike-table" for customers.&nbsp; But WeBike provides something unique: a simple and effective system that elegantly combines exercise, smart energy, sustainability, and awareness.</p>
<p>The WeBike is commercially available for 9,950&euro; and has already been installed in Exki restaurants around Belgium.</p>
