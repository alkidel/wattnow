<p>There's been a lot of buzz lately about the San Jose-based "stealth" solar company&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/">Twin Creeks</a> that recently came out of hiding with its ground-breaking Proton Induced Exfoliation (PIE) manufacturing technology that efficiently produces ultra-thin solar cells to <strong>reduce solar cell costs by up to 50%</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1942" title="Twin Creeks - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/Twin-Creeks-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="212" height="90" /></a></p>
<p>Like <a title="1366 Technologies.  Solar manufacturing for the 21st century." href="http://wattnow.org/704/1366-technologies-solar-manufacturing-for-the-21st-century">1366 Technologies</a>, Twin Creeks optimizes solar panel manufacturing by minimizing the use of silicon - and eliminating silicon waste.</p>
<p>Traditional silicon wafers have a thickness of around 150-200 microns, and <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/twin-creeks-secretive-solar-equipment-firm-unstealths/">are sliced from blocks of silicon using wire saws</a>, a process which is messy and results in lost material in the form of "silicon sawdust".</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/hyperion.html">Hyperion</a>, Twin Creeks' innovative manufacturing system, produces wafers by "exfoliation" that are 20-30 microns thick, up to <strong>10x thinner than traditional wafers</strong>, and do not produce silicon sawdust waste.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/technology/why-thin-wins.html"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1943" title="Twin Creeks - thickness" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/Twin-Creeks-thickness.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="434" height="260" /></a></p>
<p>Hyperion's proton induced exfoliation (PIE) technology injects high-energy hydrogen ions (protons) into a crystal material (re. silicon) at a finite depth. &nbsp;The hydrogen ions line up at that finite depth (between 20-30 microns), and when heated, the ions lift and peal back an ultra-thin layer called a "lamina" from the silicon donor wafer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/technology/hyperion.html"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1944" title="Twin Creeks - process" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/Twin-Creeks-process.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="420" height="157" /></a></p>
<p>Silicon is the most expensive component of a finished solar module, so to put it simply,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/technology/why-thin-wins.html">"less material, more value"</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
<p>Though Twin Creeks has been developing the Hyperion for over four years in stealth mode, they have not gone unnoticed by investors,<a  href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-57394805-54/thinly-sliced-cells-slash-solar-power-costs/?tag=txt;title"> raising $93 million from various VC investors, as well as $30 million in loans from the state of Mississippi</a><span >, where Twin Creeks has its demo plant. </span></p>
<p>Twin Creeks strategically decided to unveil the Hyperion only now after securing 20+ patents and confirming that they have a product that is tested and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/twin-creeks-secretive-solar-equipment-firm-unstealths/">"ready to ship"</a>. &nbsp;A single Hyperion 3 system, Twin Creeks' commercial-scale manufacturing tool, can process over 1.5 million thin wafers per year, which is enough to produce about <a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/technology/hyperion.html">6 MW of solar cells per year.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/technology/hyperion.html"><img class=" wp-image-1949" title="Twin Creeks - Hyperion" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/Twin-Creeks-Hyperion.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="510" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Twin Creeks expects to market the Hyperion 3 to solar vendors such as Suntech, SunPower, and Yingli. &nbsp;In parallel, the company is also investing in its own <a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/solar/demonstration-plant.html">commercial-scale production facilities</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Twin Creeks' demo plant in Senatobia, Mississippi, once fully operational, will be capable of producing 100 MW of solar modules per year. &nbsp;Twin Creeks also plans to build a 500 MW production facility in Ipoh, Malaysia.</p>
<p>The advent of Twin Creeks' technology, and other revolutionary technologies that will lead to dramatic cost efficiencies in solar manufacturing (see also&nbsp;<a title="1366 Technologies.  Solar manufacturing for the 21st century." href="http://wattnow.org/704/1366-technologies-solar-manufacturing-for-the-21st-century">1366 Technologies</a>, <a title="Alion, Inc.  Solar cells manufactured by acoustic printing." href="http://wattnow.org/1324/alion-inc-solar-cells-manufactured-by-acoustic-printing">Alion, Inc.</a>,&nbsp;and <a title="Bandgap Engineering.  Nanowire-enhanced solar cells." href="http://wattnow.org/849/bandgap-engineering-nanowire-enhanced-solar-cells">Bandgap Engineering</a>), is critical for maintaining a healthy solar industry in light of recent of market activity.</p>
<p>The price of solar has drastically decreased over the past year or so, selling for less than <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/twin-creeks-secretive-solar-equipment-firm-unstealths/">$1 per watt</a>&nbsp;and approaching 80 cents per watt. &nbsp;This is great news for consumers and the competitiveness of solar compared to other grid technologies.</p>
<p>However, the cost for manufacturers is also around 80 cents per watt, meaning that <strong>solar manufacturers are simply not making money in the current market</strong>. &nbsp;Without a change to the cost structure of solar cell fabrication, the solar manufacturing industry could quickly see a spiraling downturn (re. massive bankruptcies).</p>
<p>Twin Creeks presents a robust solution to this issue, reducing manufacturing costs to <strong><a href="http://www.twincreekstechnologies.com/solar/hyperion-value-solar.html">50 cents per watt</a></strong>, a necessary target price that simply can not be achieved with conventional technologies.</p>
<p>The challenge now is convincing solar manufacturers to invest in Twin Creeks' technology - which despite leading to critical cost reduction, will require large sums to adopt Twin Creeks' new equipment.</p>
