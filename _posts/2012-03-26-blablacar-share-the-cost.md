  content: "Good question Phil! \r\nAfter each trip, passengers leave a rating for
    their driver and vice versa.  \r\nMoreover, each person is classified with a \"level
    of experience\" - from beginner (that's where I am right now) to ambassador (see
    Mika's profile above).  Experience is based on a mix of trips conducted, ratings,
    and other factors.\r\nSee here: http://www.covoiturage.fr/confiance-fiabilite"

<p>Founded in 2006, <a href="http://www.blablacar.com/">BlablaCar</a> is a European car-sharing website with over 1.6 million members in France, Spain, and the UK. &nbsp;The site connects drivers with empty seats and paying passengers -- with the objective to reduce cost and carbon emissions for all involved. &nbsp;And above all, the site encourages social "blabla" fixtures such as profiles and ratings to assure a trustworthy ride-sharing community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blablacar.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1986" title="BlablaCar - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/BlablaCar-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a></p>
<p>The average car occupancy rate in Europe is 1.2 persons / car, which is inefficient, not very environmentally friendly, and simply expensive. &nbsp;BlablaCar estimates that average&nbsp;car ownership costs in Europe exceed 5,500 euros per year.</p>
<p>BlablaCar's average car occupancy rate has increased to 2.7 persons / car, and depending on how frequently a driver uses the site, he or she can easily <a href="http://www.blablacar.com/blog/carpooling-cost">offset over half of car-owner costs</a>&nbsp;by "renting" out his or her car seats.</p>
<p>Moreover, with every added passenger, a driver will greatly reduce his or her carbon footprint! &nbsp;<a href="http://1bog.org/blog/infographic-the-greener-way-to-get-there/">Check out this infographic </a>from <a href="http://1bog.org/">One Block Off the Grid</a> to compare CO2 emissions from various modes of transport.</p>
<p>BlablaCar is free for drivers and passengers alike to post trips / use the site. &nbsp;The business model is based on taking a <a href="http://ecosummit.net/award/eco12/startups/blablacar">small commission</a>&nbsp;(2eur / passenger / ride) on hundreds of thousands of trips per month.</p>
<p>The process is simple. &nbsp;Let's say I plan on traveling from Paris to Bordeaux this Friday. &nbsp;I type in my departure city and my arrival city and the date I plan on traveling.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.covoiturage.fr/recherche?fc=Paris+11%C3%A8me&amp;fi=36689&amp;tc=Bordeaux&amp;tci=12989&amp;d=30%2F03%2F2012&amp;to=BOTH&amp;p=1&amp;n=20&amp;t=tripsearch&amp;a=searchtrip"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1987" title="Blabla - tofrom" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/Blabla-tofrom.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="680" height="96" /></a></p>
<p>Blablacar (branded as "Covoiturage.fr" in France) returns a list options based on the route and the desired date. &nbsp;I click on the first result, which gives me a detailed profile of the driver and the trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.covoiturage.fr/trajet-paris-bordeaux-5159477"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1988" title="Blabla - Example" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/Blabla-Example.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="545" height="486" /></a></p>

<p>Mika has an excellent rating (5 stars) with 33 reviews. &nbsp;He likes to listen to music and chat ("blabla") and doesn't accept smokers. Perfect!</p>
<p>There's only one seat left in Mika's car so I sign up and reserve that last seat. &nbsp;Easy, right?</p>
<p>BlablaCar is nominated for the <a href="http://ecosummit.net/award/eco12/nominees">EcoSummit Award 2012</a>, an award for the best smart green startup (<a title="Brite Solar.  The future is Brite." href="http://wattnow.org/1960/brite-solar">Brite</a> and <a title="SolarFuel.  Smart Energy Conversion." href="http://wattnow.org/1976/solarfuel-smart-energy-conversion">SolarFuel</a>, two companies I wrote about last week are also nominated). &nbsp;Out of 52 nominees, a whopping 9 are car-sharing programs, mostly German-based companies.</p>
<p>The car-sharing system is clearly easy to implement and can have an immediate positive environmental impact. &nbsp;Now it's a question of form and reputation - who can design it best and reach out to the most people possible? &nbsp;BlablaCar, with its&nbsp;ultra-simple interface and established community, definitely seems to have a one-up on the competitors.</p>
