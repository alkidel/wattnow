<p><a href="http://www.solarus.se/index.html">Solarus</a>, located in Stockholm, Sweden, develops an innovative but gorgeously simple solar technology based on a concentrating solar capture technology.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-30-at-7.22.24-AM.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" title="Screen Shot 2011-11-30 at 7.22.24 AM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-30-at-7.22.24-AM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="194" height="82" /></a></p>
<p>Solarus' technology is designed such that solar energy is absorbed from the top of the PV panel as well as from <strong>underneath</strong>, using their <a href="http://www.solarus.se/technology.html">MaReCo</a> (Maximum Reflection Concentrator) technology, and concentrating the received sunlight by 3.5 times as much as normal PV panels!</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-30-at-7.21.42-AM.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917" title="Screen Shot 2011-11-30 at 7.21.42 AM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-30-at-7.21.42-AM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="400" height="349" /></a></p>
<p>The reflector shape is designed to absorb sunlight throughout the day, and in fact, the reflector actually gives the highest efficiency when the sun is low in the sky!</p>
<p>Moreover, the reflector is made from <a href="http://www.community.blueeconomy.de/m/articles/view/Solar-Energy-Part-2-The-Innovation">recycled carbon fibers</a> (re. cheap), and that, combined with a design that requires far less of the expensive silicon solar cells, makes the Solarus solar system <a href="http://www.solarus.se/products.html">competitive with fossil fuels</a>.</p>
<p>Solarus produces a 300W standalone rooftop Micro Hybrid System (PV / thermal), enough to power basic lighting and electronic appliances of a small home. &nbsp;Solarus is actively promoting this product in developing countries where the cost of traditional solar panels is too prohibitive. &nbsp;The 300W panel is also designed to be scalable and with 8-12 panels, a home (in Sweden)&nbsp;could become <a href="http://www.community.blueeconomy.de/m/articles/view/Solar-Energy-Part-4-The-Opportunity">energy independent</a>, covering hot water, electricity and room heating.</p>
<p>The Solarus product is simple, resourceful, and practical - in essence, an exemplary innovation of once again, <a title="The Blue Economy.  A new way of designing business." href="http://wattnow.org/898/the-blue-economy-a-new-way-of-designing-business">The Blue Economy</a>.</p>
