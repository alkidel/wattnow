<p>It almost seems like magic the way that <a href="http://alphabetenergy.com/">Alphabet Energy</a>, based in San Francisco, CA, can <strong>turn waste heat</strong> - like exhaust coming out of your car, or a factory chimney spewing out hot steam - <strong>into electricity</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/alphabet-energy.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-627 alignnone" title="alphabet energy" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/alphabet-energy.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="207" height="81" /></a></p>
<p>Initially developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Alphabet Energy's silicon-based thermoelectric technology has "<a href="http://alphabetenergy.com/index.php?action=products">cracked the code</a>" for turning silicon into an efficient thermoelectric material.</p>
<p>What are thermoelectrics exactly? &nbsp;When a thermoelectric material (in Alphabet's case, a silicon product) experiences a temperature difference (ie. is exposed to waste heat), the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_effect">device creates a voltage difference</a>. &nbsp;A voltage difference will then lead to an electric current.</p>
<p>Seems so simple, right? &nbsp;Totally. &nbsp;The trouble is designing a technology that is efficient, inexpensive, <em>and</em> scalable. &nbsp;And it seems Alphabet Energy has hit the spot on all three.</p>
<p>Alphabet's products are particularly interesting for industrial facilities, which could meet 25-100% of their electricity needs from waste heat.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/factory-chimney.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-629 alignnone" title="Global Warming" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/factory-chimney.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="313" height="208" /></a></p>
<p>Also, the US Army and US Airforce, which are constantly looking to boost energy efficiency in the military's battlefield operations through their Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs, have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pitchengine.com/zingpr/alphabet-energy-awarded-148m-in-sbir-phase-ii-contracts/127639/">signed over $1 million in Phase II contracts with Alphabet</a>&nbsp;for special field applications.</p>
<p>Alphabet aims to reach full commercialization in 2012/2013 and be the world leader in the heat recovery industry with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabless_semiconductor_company">fabless manufacturing model</a>. &nbsp;We're talking about an $100 billion global market.</p>
<p>Probably not a bad place to <a href="http://alphabetenergy.com/index.php?action=careers">look for a job</a>. &nbsp;Hmm.</p>
