<p><a href="https://relayrides.com/">RelayRides</a>&nbsp;connects people who need a car with their neighbors who own a car, in order to borrow that car for as little as $5/hour.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/relay-rides.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-712" title="relay rides" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/relay-rides.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="426" height="141" /></a></p>

<p>It's a win-win-win...win! situation.</p>
<p>The borrower wins - because it's free to sign up, it's super cheap ($5/hour includes gas!), and it's crazy convenient.</p>
<p>The lender wins - because he makes money for doing nothing (ie. lending out his car when it would have been just sitting idle anyway)!</p>
<p>RelayRides wins - because they get a small piece of the cake (15%) to cover their costs for managing this awesome system.</p>
<p>And let's add another "win" into that combination, because best of all, a <a href="http://www.citycarshare.org/pressrelease_01-12-04.do">study done at UC Berkeley</a> showed that <strong>car-sharing reduces the number of vehicles on the road</strong> (i.e. people decide not to buy a car when they sign up to car-share) - which makes total sense, AND...<strong>car-sharing lowers emissions</strong> because when people car-share instead of owning a car, they make different choices about transport, ie. they decide to walk, bike or take public transport instead of taking a car unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Lenders and borrowers alike can sleep well at night, because RelayRides has an <a href="https://relayrides.com/borrowers/common-questions">$1,000,000 insurance policy </a>to cover any damages that may occur during a reservation. &nbsp;Phew!</p>
<p>Awesome, right?</p>
<p>Ideally, we should just get rid of cars all-together. &nbsp;Which could be possible in very densely-populated cities (Paris' mayor Bertrand Delanoie dreams of car-less Paris, which I believe could one day happen). &nbsp;But let's face it - especially in most US cities, cars will not go away anytime soon. &nbsp;And they are really convenient sometimes.</p>
<p>RelayRides currently operates in San Francisco and the Boston area and has&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/carbon-reduction-sustainable-car-sharing">3000 members sharing 200 cars</a>. &nbsp;They plan to expand around the US and hopefully overseas, especially to China and India. &nbsp;As Shelby Clark, RelayRides founder puts it, "it could be a disaster for everybody if the middle class in India and China adopt an American model of car ownership".</p>
