<p><strong><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/">ideabox</a></strong>, based in Salem, Oregon, is a prefab housing design studio that builds modular homes that are energy efficient and affordable, and designed to be <a href="http://www.ideabox.us/process/">"lively yet relaxing, small yet big, warm yet cool and most of all simply fun"</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1911" title="ideabox - logo2" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/ideabox-logo2.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Where <a href="http://wattnow.org/1453/project-frog-smart-building-try-genius-building">Project Frog</a>, another prefab design studio, designs for larger buildings like schools and stores, <strong>ideabox</strong> focuses on compact homes ranging from the <strong><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/models/minibox/">minibox</a></strong> at 200 ft2 (~20m2) to the <strong><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/models/confluence-3/">confluence 3</a></strong> at 1470 ft2 (150m2).</p>

<p><strong>ideabox</strong> offers a "design phase" with each customer to assist on everything from placement of the home and necessary permits to customizing the size and style of the house. &nbsp;The home arrives prefabricated in one or two pieces - prefabrication allows less material waste and less energy consumption than building on-site.</p>
<p>Moreover,<strong> ideabox</strong> houses are designed for ultimate energy efficiency - including <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=about.ab_index">Energy Star</a> appliances, LED light-fixtures, and water efficient pipes.</p>
<p><strong>ideabox</strong> recently partnered with IKEA to present the <strong><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/models/aktiv/">aktiv</a>, </strong>a new line of houses designed by ideabox around IKEA systems - 745 ft2 (76m2) for ~$86,500.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/models/aktiv/"><img class=" wp-image-1913  " title="ideabox - aktiv" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/ideabox-aktiv.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="504" height="337" /></a></p>
<p><strong>ideabox</strong> is also designing prefab floating homes with its <strong><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/models/drift/">drift </a></strong>series:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ideabox.us/models/drift/"><img class=" wp-image-1914   " title="ideabox - drift" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/ideabox-drift.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="624" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>Like the <a title="ReVolt House.  Energy adaptive floating unit." href="http://wattnow.org/1817/revolt-house-energy-adaptive-floating-unit">ReVolt house</a>, a solar-powered floating home, <strong>ideabox's</strong> <strong>drift</strong> <strong>series</strong> will be important for the development of floating communities that we are seeing in the Netherlands and coastal areas.</p>
<p>Since the recession,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.registerguard.com/web/business/27436027-41/houses-ideabox-square-built-russell.html.csp">small houses</a>&nbsp;are making a comeback, especially for young couples who not only are trying to save money, but are interested in reducing their carbon footprint.</p>
<p><strong>ideabox</strong> is also targeting retired seniors who are looking to downsize in space with its resort-inspired "micro neighborhood", a pilot called <a href="http://www.ideabox.us/cottages-at-camelot/">Cottages@Camelot</a>&nbsp;which is being launched&nbsp;in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>ideabox</strong> was launched in 2006, and has since sold 30 houses.</p>
