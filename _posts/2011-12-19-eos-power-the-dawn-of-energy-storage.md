<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.eosenergystorage.com/">Eos</a>, based in Easton, PA, is developing a game-changing low-cost, rechargeable&nbsp;<strong>zinc-air battery storage technology</strong> for utility and transportation applications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.eosenergystorage.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1097 alignnone" title="eoslogo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/eoslogo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="306" height="150" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike other high-tech storage technologies (re. lithium ion batteries as produced by <a title="A123.  Game changing energy storage solutions." href="http://wattnow.org/728/a123-game-changing-energy-storage-solutions">A123</a>), zinc-air batteries are made from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc%E2%80%93air_battery">non-toxic, non-flammable materials</a>. &nbsp;Moreover, zinc-air batteries demonstrate tremendous promise because they have a high energy storage capacity and are relatively inexpensive to produce. &nbsp;Can you imagine - a battery that just requires oxygen as a reactant, in other words,<strong> air from its surrounding</strong>, to generate current?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And zinc-air batteries already exist in many applications, most notably hearing-aids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With all these advantages, why then, isn't every electric vehicle on the road running on zinc-air batteries?!?!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The major challenge with zinc-air batteries, one that other zinc-air companies like <a href="http://www.revolttechnology.com/">ReVolt</a>&nbsp;has been facing for years, is <a href="http://technologyreview.in/business/23812/page1/">making them rechargeable</a>. &nbsp;Zinc-air batteries are cheaper and lighter than lithium ion batteries, but run down much more quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eos however, claims to have developed proprietary innovations to "overcome historical limitations to <a href="http://www.eosenergystorage.com/technology">electric rechargeability of zinc-air batteries</a>".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eos' batteries have demonstrated the most cycles ever realized by metal-air batteries, <a href="http://www.eosenergystorage.com/technology">>2000 battery cycles with no physical degradation</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eos plans to start initial manufacturing for their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eosenergystorage.com/products">Aurora systems</a> in 2012, and delivery of MW scale system for grid storage applications in 2013, which will then be the point of departure for the automotive implementation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many people consider efficient and low-cost energy storage to be the key ingredient for both</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>successful integration of renewables into the grid,</li>
<li>large scale adoption of electric vehicles.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Will Eos' zinc-air battery technology be that special ingredient to make the perfect recipe of a renewable electric power ecosystem?</p>
