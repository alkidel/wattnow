<p>Based in New York City, <a href="http://www.thinkecoinc.com/">ThinkEco</a> has developed the patent-pending <strong><a href="http://themodlet.com/features.html">Modlet</a>&nbsp;</strong>("modern outlet"), an intelligent outlet that optimizes energy use of electronic appliances.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/thinkeco-logo.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1764" title="thinkeco - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/thinkeco-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="297" height="79" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standby_power">Standby power</a>&nbsp;is wasted electricity consumed by electronic appliances when they are switched off, amounting to about <a href="http://standby.lbl.gov/faq.html#what">5-10% of residential electricity use</a>. &nbsp;Think about your television. &nbsp;Or your desktop computer. &nbsp;Or your coffee machine. &nbsp;Or your air conditioner. &nbsp;And the list goes on.</p>
<p><a href="http://standby.lbl.gov/summary-table.html">This chart</a> which outlines the amount of power used by various appliances in on/off/sleep modes. &nbsp;If your laptop consumes up to 50W even when it is turned <em>off, </em>why not just unplug it?</p>
<p>Or,&nbsp;have a device unplug it for you? &nbsp;Enter <strong>the Modlet</strong>.</p>
<p>The Modlet provides intelligent use of electricity - like what the&nbsp;<a title="The Nest Learning Thermostat.  Programs itself.  Keeps you comfortable.  Saves energy when you&rsquo;re away." href="http://wattnow.org/1025/the-nest-learning-thermostat">Nest</a>&nbsp;does for heating. &nbsp;But the Modlet is even simpler than the Nest; it's just a smart on/off switch. &nbsp;The Modlet completely disconnects appliances when they are not needed (generally at night or when you're away from home). &nbsp;And then re-connects the appliances when they are.</p>
<p><a href="http://themodlet.com/features.html"><img class=" wp-image-1765" title="thinkeco - modlet" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/thinkeco-modlet.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="558" height="276" /></a></p>
<p>The Modlet&nbsp;plugs into a wall socket and wirelessly connects to a computer through a USB key, and provides easy-to use interface software to monitor and control the power usage of electronic devices.</p>
<p>This basic on/off binary concept proves to be extremely efficient - for residents and commercial units alike. &nbsp;More than <a href="http://thinkecoinc.com/data/2.9.12%20-%20Greentech%20Media%20-%20ThinkEco%20Thinks%20Beyond%20the%20Smart%20Plug.pdf">25% of electricity that companies use</a> goes to plug loads (computers, printers, water coolers, etc), meaning ample margin to optimize standby power usage for commercial buildings as well as houses.</p>
<p>The Modlet is already on the market and the most basic unit, the&nbsp;<a href="http://themodlet.com/buy_home.html">home starter kit</a> rings in at $50, and pays for itself in 6-12 months.</p>
<p>Home energy management (HEM) is a hot 2.0 topic - and rightfully so. &nbsp;It's exciting for an individual to have control over his energy consumption - and how else are we going to encourage behavior changes if we do not empower individuals with knowledge and control?</p>
<p>At the same time, there's so many new HEM systems and gadgets coming out, that it can be overwhelming and over-complicated for a newbie. &nbsp;If you are interested in tapping into this realm, ThinkEco's Modlet seems to be a good, easy, no-risk place to start. &nbsp;And a way to quickly understand and control your electricity usage. &nbsp;And make an immediate difference.</p>
<p>ThinkEco is taking efficiency one step further and partnering with Con Edison to improve usage of window air conditioners by allowing users to adjust and control temperature remotely.</p>
<p>Beyond the Modlet's extremely cute exterior, ThinkEco is exploring a wide range of efficiency innovation with this genius device.</p>
