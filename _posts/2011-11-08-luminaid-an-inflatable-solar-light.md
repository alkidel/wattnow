<p>Incubated at Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, the <a href="http://www.luminaidlab.com/index">LuminAID solar lamp</a>&nbsp;is an ultra-portable, water-proof, solar-powered lamp.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.luminaidlab.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-742" title="luminAIDgrass (2)" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/luminAIDgrass-2.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="2250" height="1500" /></a></p>

<p>The LuminAID lamp's solar system is designed for people without regular access to electricity and for victims of a natural disaster. &nbsp;In other words, the lamp is designed to be robust, portable, waterproof, and ... a safer and more cost-effective alternative to kerosene lamps -- very similar to the <a title="NOKERO and En&egrave;ji Pw&ograve;p. Bringing solar-powered light to rural Haiti." href="http://wattnow.org/661/nokero-and-eneji-pwop-bringing-solar-light-to-rural-haiti">NOKERO</a> lamps that I wrote about last week.</p>
<p>What I find especially awesome about the design of the LuminAID lamp is its ultra-compactness. &nbsp;You can pack and ship up to <a href="http://www.luminaidlab.com/what.html">50 LuminAID inflatable lamps for every 8 equivalent solar lightbulbs</a>.</p>
<p>(You then inflate the lamp into a pillow-shape to help diffuse the light)</p>
<p>After <a title="NOKERO and En&egrave;ji Pw&ograve;p. Bringing solar-powered light to rural Haiti." href="http://wattnow.org/661/nokero-and-eneji-pwop-bringing-solar-light-to-rural-haiti">my experience in Haiti last month </a>and starting to understand the absurd complexity associated with supply chain and distribution systems, I really appreciate the value of this compact shipping advantage. &nbsp;To give you an idea, for the NOKERO lamps that we were distributing in Haiti, <strong>the cost of distribution was higher than the cost of manufacturing</strong>. &nbsp;I don't know about you, but I thought that was nuts. &nbsp;Making a solar bulb? &nbsp;Easy as cake. &nbsp;Getting it from China to Haiti - yea see ya in six months.</p>
<p>Anyway, just goes to show you that <a href="http://www.luminaidlab.com/who.html">Anna and Andrea</a>&nbsp;(the two brains&nbsp;behind LuminAID) really thought about every aspect of an appropriate design.</p>
<p>Right on!</p>
