<p style="text-align: justify;">Numerous companies - <a title="1366 Technologies.  Solar manufacturing for the 21st century." href="http://wattnow.org/704/1366-technologies-solar-manufacturing-for-the-21st-century">1366</a>, <a title="Bandgap Engineering.  Nanowire-enhanced solar cells." href="http://wattnow.org/849/bandgap-engineering-nanowire-enhanced-solar-cells">Bandgap</a>, <a title="Twin Creeks Technologies.  A new era in thin crystalline wafers." href="http://wattnow.org/1936/twin-creeks-technologies-a-new-era-in-thin-crystalline-wafers">Twin Creeks</a>, and more - are striving to optimize solar cell efficiency or manufacturing to bring down solar costs.  Regardless of the innovative process, the end-result is generally the same: a flat panel that is fixed on a rooftop or other surface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A team of researchers at MIT is considering a different approach -- and thinking more like the cinema industry as of late:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://web.mit.edu/press/2012/three-dimensional-solar-energy.html"><strong>Why not 3-D?  </strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://web.mit.edu/press/media.html?id=14913"><img title="MIT-3dsolar" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/04/MIT-3dsolar.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="467" height="302" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MIT team has modeled a wide variety of three-dimensional configurations with results showing improvements of double to <strong>up to 20x more power generated than conventional panels</strong> for a given area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The vertical surfaces of the 3-D towers allow to collect more sunlight during mornings and evenings -- and the 3-D structures are especially productive in unfavorable conditions for solar power - cloudy days, winter months, and locations far from the equator.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The accordion-like tower, the team's latest and tallest structure, is designed not only for performance but also for shipping - the idea is to ship the tower flat and unfold it at the site of installation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://web.mit.edu/press/media.html?id=14913"><img title="MIT-3dsolar-2" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/04/MIT-3dsolar-2-682x1024.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="241" height="362" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though 3-D is considerably more expensive than 2-D, requiring many more solar modules, the MIT team claims the costs are offset by the increased efficiency.  Moreover, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/press/2012/three-dimensional-solar-energy.html">Professor Jeffrey Grossman notes</a> that "the cost for silicon cells is a fraction of the total cost, a trend that will continue downward in the near future".  Today, up to 65% of the price of solar are costs associated with <a href="http://wattnow.org/704/1366-technologies-solar-manufacturing-for-the-21st-century">"post-manufacturing"</a> costs including installation, permits, and other components.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MIT team has achieved an impressive first step with their successful modeling of individual 3-D structures.  The next step is to study a collection of towers and the impact of their shadows on each other.  And eventually, the team must demonstrate the commercial viability of 3-D solar structures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I foresee a spinoff startup in the near future...</p>
