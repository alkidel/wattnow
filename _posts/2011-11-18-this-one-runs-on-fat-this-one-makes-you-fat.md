<p>I don't have time to write a full article today, but just wanted to share this tag that an artist in NYC is spray painting on sidewalks and buildings.</p>
<p>via Sue Young via <a href="http://www.bicyclespacewdc.com/">BicycleSpace</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bicyclespacewdc.com/"><img title="bicyclespace" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/bicyclespace.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="602" height="319" /></a></p>
<p>On the subject of how awesome bicycles are, I saw "<a href="http://theartblog.org/2011/11/business-genius-and-hippie-steve-jobs-the-lost-interview/">The Lost Interview</a>" last night, an interview with Steve Jobs from 1995, and as Steve so well explained, in terms of how animals rank in terms of locomation efficiency (how much energy exerted / distance traveled),</p>
<p>"the condor won. It was the most efficient. Humankind came in with an unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list. But somebody there had the brilliance to <strong>test a human riding a bicycle. We blew away the condor. Off the charts.</strong></p>
<p>This really had an impact on me. <strong>Humans are tool builders. We build tools that can dramatically amplify our innate human abilities.</strong> We ran an ad for this once that the personal computer is the bicycle of the mind. I believe that with every bone in my body."</p>
<p>So yea, bikes are awesome. &nbsp;And bikes make people awesome.</p>
