  content: How have these companies progressed through the middle ground of customer
    development? The technologies are daring and certainly innovative, but how long
    out before commercialization. If they are low cost and competitive, which I tend
    to believe, are they sustainable without PTC/ITC or REC's?

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.altaerosenergies.com/">Altaeros Energies</a>, based in Cambridge, MA,&nbsp;is&nbsp;developing airborne wind turbines (AWT).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why "airborne" ? &nbsp;The wind turbines are sent to higher heights using blimp-like technology, where winds are stronger and more stable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/altaeros.png"><img title="altaeros" src="../wp-content/uploads/2011/04/altaeros.png" alt="" width="471" height="130" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though little information is provided on the website, here is a photo of the first Altaeros AWT prototype:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/honeywells-take-on-wind-turbines-and-the-flying-donut-from-mit/"><img class="size-full wp-image-97 alignnone" title="airborne_wind_alteros" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/04/airborne_wind_alteros.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="347" height="260" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Awesome concept. &nbsp;But two (maybe stupid) questions: 1) how is the wind energy converted into electricity, and 2) how do we distribute the electricity from the AWT to where it will be consumed (ie. the ground)?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">* Response from Altaeros: "The power is transmitted to the ground using a conductive cable, similar to those used to power radar systems lifted by tethered balloons called aerostats". &nbsp;Thank you!</p>
