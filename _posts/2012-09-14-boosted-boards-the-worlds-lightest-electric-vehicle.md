  content: While it is a great innovation for an electric vehicle; the liability that
    may accrue to the manufacturer, distributor or retailer of such a non-safe vehicle
    will kill its sales. The variance in local laws on what are called "skateboards"
    in the USA will keep it from taking off.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.boostedboards.com/">Boosted Boards</a></strong>, based in Palo Alto, CA, has designed an electric-powered longboard with 2.6 horsepower and regenerative breaking, and the technology is positioned not only as an improved skateboard, but as the world's lightest electric vehicle.</p>

<p>The <strong>Boosted Board</strong>&nbsp;is a technical wonder: it has a top speed of 20 mph (kind of like a bike), 6-mile range before charging, and weighs only 12 lbs (thank you lithion ion batteries and brushless motors).</p>

<p>The board comes with a handheld remote to control throttle, braking, and display your battery gauge.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/170315130/boosted-boards-the-worlds-lightest-electric-vehicl">Boosted Board</a> is clean, convenient, and portable, boasting very pertinent advantages over other modes of transport (re. avoiding the bike theft phenomenon).</p>

<p>Despite the buzz, I&rsquo;m not totally convinced the Boosted Board is a product for the masses as they are marketing it out to be - for safety reasons (the maternal instincts are kicking in), and practical reasons too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Boosted Board has quite a hefty pricetag at the moment at $1299.</p>
<p>Reminds me of the Segway -- great for doing tours around cities or for giggles at the Google complex, but didn&rsquo;t quite hit the streets the way they planned.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Boosted Boards is getting rave reviews from its beta users and if the vibe grows, Boosted could really revolutionize city transport.</p>
