<p><a href="http://www.ulule.com/paperflops/">PaperFlops</a>&nbsp;employs underprivileged people, including street children and disabled people, at a creative workshop in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to convert newspapers and other waste ... &nbsp;into flip flops ! &nbsp;And beyond being recycled, they are just really cool-looking flip flops.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/paperflops.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class=" wp-image-454 alignnone" title="paperflops" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/paperflops.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="448" height="252" /></a></p>
<p>It takes about 1kg of old newspaper, and some other natural materials (root from old palm trees, coconut shells, and 100% natural rubber) to make a pair of PaperFlops. &nbsp; And the flip flops are protected with a natural rubber sealant -- so not only are the flip flops recycled and stylish, but they are durable and water proof too!</p>
<p>The PaperFlops are currently distributed for 26euro on <a href="http://www.ulule.com/">Ulule</a>, a crowdfunding platform, kind of like <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> but with a more social and environmental focus.</p>
<p>When I was in Laos, I came across a similar project called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/mekongpsdf.nsf/AttachmentsByTitle/17-Lao-Peuan+Mit/$FILE/17-Lao-Peuan+Mit.pdf">Peuan Mit</a>&nbsp;("Close Friend" in Lao) dedicated to helping street children re-integrate into Lao society with a number of training solutions - including a delicious restaurant called <a href="http://www.hanuman.travel/Responsible_Tourism/Laos/Mak_Phet_Restaurant.html">Makphet</a>&nbsp;and an awesome little store called the Noi Noi Shop with crafts made out of recycled materials and made by the parents of street children. &nbsp;I got this cool newspaper-purse at the shop which I still use after 4 years:</p>

<p>If you're in Vientiene, you must check out the Makphet restaurant and Noi Noi shop.</p>
<p>If you won't be in Vientiene anytime soon, but you find yourself in the Boulder area, you should check out <a href="http://ourmomentum.com/">MomentuM</a>, a store which carries beatiful handmade crafts often made from recycled materials.</p>
<p>But first step, I just ordered my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ulule.com/paperflops/">PaperFlops</a>. &nbsp;Did you?</p>
