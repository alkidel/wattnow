<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://beta.econofy.com/">Econofy</a>&nbsp;is a web application that helps online shoppers find efficient products and determine how much the shoppers would save by replacing an existing product with a more efficient one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://beta.econofy.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1647" title="econofy - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/econofy-logo1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="185" height="51" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Econofy displays popular Amazon products and pulls the EnergyStar ratings data for the items (using the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface"> API</a>s from both sites) and then provides a "comparison ROI calculator".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://beta.econofy.com/calculator"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1648" title="econofy - comparison" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/econofy-comparison.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="475" height="326" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ok, let's be honest. &nbsp;The website is in beta and the concept is great but the functionality and design of the application are not particularly impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What IS exciting is that Econofy was created in one single weekend - at the second official <a href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/">Cleanweb Hackathon</a> held in New York City last weekend (Jan 20-22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A hack-a-what? &nbsp;A hackathon is a competition targeted towards developers and designers to come up with new applications/software/websites in a limited amount of time. &nbsp;And generally pizza and beer is involved. &nbsp;Hackathons are extremely efficient in producing a plethora of ideas in a short amount of time. &nbsp;A major win-win situation. &nbsp;The hackers get to do what they love best - program - in a collaborative and funky environment with other like-minded geeks. &nbsp;The sponsors, with little investment, get access to a wide variety of ideas. &nbsp;And potential new hires.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cleanweb Hackathon was a gathering of about 100 developers dedicated to creating apps that address <a href="http://ecopreneurist.com/2012/01/24/cleanweb-hackathon-nyc-winning-app-helps-shoppers-find-efficient-appliances/">"resource constraints"</a>. &nbsp;with an impressive panel of judges including venture capitalists, the NYC Chief Digital Officer, and the US Chief Technology Officer. &nbsp;The event went from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon with a <a href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/agenda/">loaded schedule</a>&nbsp;(and plenty of food breaks). &nbsp;The prizes are not entirely clear but it seems that the best team <a href="http://cleanwebhack.com/hackathon/prizes/">received at minima one week of training</a>, workshops, and consultations from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greenstart.com/">Greenstart</a>, an energy and IT startup accelerator, to turn the hack into a real company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, Econofy was the overall winner. &nbsp;Right on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which means we'll hopefully be seeing some improvements on the website in upcoming weeks. &nbsp;Especially if the Econofy folks do the Greenstart Accelerator Week.</p>
