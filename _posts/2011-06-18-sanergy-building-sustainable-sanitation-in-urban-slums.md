<p><a href="http://saner.gy/">Sanergy</a> was started by a group of MIT grads - a mix of MBAs, engineers, and designers - to develop an innovative model of sustainable sanitation for the slums of Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p>The primary objective of the project is to create clean and affordable sanitation.&nbsp; Sanergy takes this objective further by developing a model that not only provides clean toilets, but then uses the human waste products to produce energy, all designed in a way to create a solution that is clean, sustainable, and economic every step of the way.</p>
<p><a href="http://saner.gy/project/"><img class="size-full wp-image-258 alignnone" title="sanergy" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/06/sanergy2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="452" height="303" /></a></p>
<p>The model has three parts - First, creating a network of low-cost, robust sanitation centers, for people to access clean toilets and showers (either on a pay-as-you-go or subscription basis).&nbsp; The idea is that these centers be funding by micro-finance banks and run by local entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Second, collecting the waste, which is stored in air-tight containers, and then transported to a centralized processing center with an optimized distribution network.</p>
<p>Third, processing the waste with an anaerobic digester to generate biogas for producing electricity.&nbsp; The remaining solid waste of the biogas generation will then be used as high-quality fertilizer.</p>
<p>Sanergy reminds me of&nbsp;<a title="The Power of Dog Poop" href="http://wattnow.org/79/the-power-of-dog-poop">Park Spark Project</a>.&nbsp; Using an anaerobic digester to turn poop into energy.&nbsp; Obviously two very different applications.&nbsp; But both demonstrating the exciting and creative potential of turning waste into energy.</p>
<p>In May, Sanergy won MIT's $100K business plan competition and more recently won the Echoing Green Fellowship -- now that the guys behind the idea have graduated, they will have the time (and money!) to go fully implement the project.&nbsp; Congratulations and good luck!</p>
<p>Thanks Millie for the info!</p>
