<p><a href="http://www.xlhybrids.com/">XL Hybrids</a>, based in Somerville, MA, has developed a technology to convert existing conventional vehicles into hybrid electric vehicles by installing a simple <a href="http://www.xlhybrids.com/products/conversion">add-on kit</a> that reduces fuel consumption by 15-30%.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/xl-hybrids.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-435" title="xl hybrids" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/xl-hybrids.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="74" height="80" /></a></p>

<p>The installation takes about 6 hours to integrate the <a href="http://www.xlhybrids.com/products/livery">electric motor under the car</a> and a lithium ion <a href="http://www.xlhybrids.com/products/livery">battery pack snuggly tucked into the trunk</a>, while still leaving ample space for luggage.</p>

<p>Though the hybrid conversion can be applied to any car, XL Hybrids focuses on fleets of Town Cars as an appropriate first client base for the technology: Town Cars have a niche market providing luxury comfort and spaciousness, however they have very low efficiency (13-15 miles/gallon). &nbsp;And drivers of Town Cars are usually doing a lot of miles and a lot of <em>city </em>miles, so they are<strong> particularly sensitive to fuel economics</strong>.</p>
<p>The hybrid conversion for a Town Car will pay for itself within 24 months, so for an existing Town Car that will be on the road for another 3-5 years, the hybrid conversion is a great investment, especially with rising gas prices.</p>
<p>I think this is a really cool and pragmatic business plan - for today. &nbsp;But is there a growth market? &nbsp;I assume that in 5 years, all new Town Cars (and cars general) will be hybrid or will have higher efficiencies, making this sort of "add-on" technology less attractive. &nbsp;What then? &nbsp;I'm sure the guys at XL Hybrids have it figured out. &nbsp;We'll just have to wait and see!</p>
