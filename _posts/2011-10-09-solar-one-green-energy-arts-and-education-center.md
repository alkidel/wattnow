<p style="text-align: justify;">I truly believe that the local community is a powerful platform for change. &nbsp;And that's why I really like <a href="http://solar1.org/">Solar One</a>. &nbsp;Located in Steyvesant Cove Park in Manhattan, Solar One is a solar-powered "hub" for New Yorkers focused on energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/solarone.gif' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-649" title="solarone" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/solarone.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="915" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Solar One's mission is to empower residents and visitors with the knowledge and resources about energy to move forward and create a cleaner and more sustainable future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Solar One does this through outreach, educational programs (like the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/solaronegreendesignlab/">Green Design Lab</a> implemented in New York schools), trainings (for example, building analyst, solar installation), and even with the <a href="http://solar1.org/events/">arts</a>, organizing an annual Green Energy Arts Festival and many other integrated energy-arts events like the <a href="http://solar1.org/about/">Solar-Powered Film Series</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since its inception in 2003, Solar One has been largely successful, so much so that they intend to expand with&nbsp;<a href="http://solar1.org/solar2/">Solar 2</a>, a space that is 10x the size of Solar One and the first carbon-neutral, net-zero energy building in New York City. &nbsp;Solar 2 is expected to open in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The local energy one-stop wonderland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Awesome.</p>
