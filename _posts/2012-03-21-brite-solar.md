<p><strong><a href="http://www.britesolar.com/">Brite Solar</a></strong>, based in Athens, Greece, is developing 3rd generation photovoltaic technology to produce&nbsp;<strong>solar windows</strong> for homes and office buildings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.britesolar.com/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1963" title="brite - logo2" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/brite-logo2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="412" height="146" /></a></p>
<p>Brite Solar's PanePower Solar Technology is based on <a href="http://www.britesolar.com/attachments/article/11/Brite's_Profile_07_2010.pdf">Dry Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC)</a>, a composite of organic and inorganic lightweight nanostructure cells, and uses a patented solid electrolyte, which guarantees long-term robustness as compared to other existing DSSC technologies, which are mainly based on liquid electrolytes. &nbsp;This low-cost thin film technology:</p>
<ul >
<li>is <strong>transparent</strong>,</li>
<li>functions with&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.britesolar.com/technology/competitive-advantages">diffuse radiation</a></strong>, absorbing light from any direction and from either side, and</li>
<li>operates with <strong>natural and artificial light</strong>,</li>
</ul>
<p><span >making the system an ideal "photovoltaic window".</span></p>
<p><span >Though other players such as </span><a  title="Wysips.  What you see is photovoltaic surface." href="http://wattnow.org/1540/wysips-what-you-see-is-photovoltaic-surface">Wysips</a><span > and </span><a  title="MotionPower.  Harnessing excess vehicle energy." href="http://wattnow.org/1611/motionpower">New Energy Technologies Inc.</a><span >&nbsp;are also actively developing transparent solar systems, this window technology is not yet available in mass production today.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.britesolar.com/index.php"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1964" title="brite - windows" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/brite-windows.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="620" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>Brite Solar's objective is to achieve panel efficiency of 8% at a fraction of the production and capex costs of silicon Thin Film solar panels.</p>
<p>Brite Solar believes that DSSC technology will succeed due to low cost, substrate flexibility, and its ability to perform in dim or variable lighting conditions. &nbsp;Brite Solar is targeting the <a href="http://www.britesolar.com/attachments/article/11/Brite's_Profile_07_2010.pdf">Building Integrated PV (BIPV) market</a>, growing substantially from $528 million in 2008 to <a href="http://www.britesolar.com/attachments/article/11/Brite's_Profile_07_2010.pdf">$8.2 billion by 2015</a>.</p>
<p>Established in 2009, Brite Solar is funded primarily by its founders&nbsp;CEO Dr. Nick Kanopoulos, CTO Prof. Panagiotis Lianos, VP Engineering Prof. Elias Stathatos. &nbsp;Brite Solar was selected by the OECD as one of the best Business Cases of Eco-Innovation in 2011 and is currently&nbsp;nominated for a <a href="http://ecosummit.net/award/eco12/startups/brite">EcoSummit 2012 award</a>.</p>
<p>Brite Solar's PanePower system is exciting not only for its technological splendor and its promising potential, but also, that it is --&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://goodnews.gr/Articles/Elliniki-neofyis-eteria-diekdiki-diakrisi-sto-ECOSUMMIT-gia-fotoboltaika-tzamia_1403.html">Made In Greece</a></strong>.</p>
<p>During this sour economic period, where Greeks might be feeling bitter, confused, and abandoned, Brite Solar emerges with its positive and inspiring project that combines two of Greece's best qualities : sun and science.</p>
