<p><a href="http://www.vegawatt.com/">Vegawatt</a>, located in Boylston, MA, provides restaurants with an on-site combined heat and power (CHP) system to use waste vegetable oil (WVO) as fuel to generate electricity and hot water for the restaurant.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vegawatt.com/"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1008" title="vegawatt" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/vegawatt-150x150.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>Vegawatt's cogeneration technology includes a patent-pending 4-step cleaning process to transform "the <a href="http://www.vegawatt.com/about-Vegawatt/">darkest, nastiest used cooking oil</a> into fuel appropriate for power generation". &nbsp;Mmm tasty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vegawatt.com/Vegawatt-brochures/"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1009" title="vegawatt-unit" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/vegawatt-unit-180x300.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="180" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The systems provide up 10-25% of a restaurant's electricity needs and at about $32,000 for a 5kW system, a restaurant will see a <a href="http://www.vegawatt.com/cost-analysis/">payback in 2-3 years</a>.</p>
<p>Vegawatt also provides a <a href="http://www.vegawatt.com/cost-analysis/">leasing option</a> where restaurants can start recycling their cooking oil and save money immediately!</p>
<p>Vegawatt combines the the re-use of WVO (as seen at&nbsp;<a title="Green Grease Monkey.  Vegetable fueled vehicle systems and more." href="http://wattnow.org/478/green-grease-monkey-vegetable-fueled-vehicle-systems-and-more">Green Grease Monkey</a>)&nbsp;and on-site waste recycling via CHP technology (as seen at&nbsp;<a title="Methane Harvest.  Lower costs.  Sustainable energy." href="http://wattnow.org/920/methane-harvest-lower-costs-sustainable-energy">Methane Harvest</a>) to provide a fantastic closed-loop system of energy use for restaurants. &nbsp;The system saves money, is clean, and what I really like about these on-site systems is the elimination of transmission and distribution - which can be incredibly cost-intensive and wasteful.</p>
<p>With Vegawatt's system, you open the backdoor to your restaurant, pour leftover cooking oil into the refrigerator-sized unit, and voila - not only do you not have to deal with getting rid of the grimy stuff, but ... the lights go on!</p>
