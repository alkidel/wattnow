<p><a href="http://www.tbideas.com/index.php"><strong>Loochi</strong></a>, brought to you by TBIdeas based in Santa Cruz, CA, is the first Bluetooth4 smart lamp that allows the user to control and animate lighting wirelessly from a smartphone. &nbsp;Moreover, Loochi is open-source for hardware, software, AND design, allowing for endless lighting creativity to evolve. &nbsp;Did someone say Loochi-based building-size Tetris?</p>

<p>While the<a href="http://paris.leweb.co/"> LeWeb 2012 conference</a> takes place this week in Paris with the theme "Internet of Things", TBIdeas has launched its first crowdfunding campaign for <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/loochi?c=home">the Loochi on Indiegogo</a>.</p>
<p>The "Internet of Things" explores how objects are connected and communicate with each other - smart phones, smart cars, smart appliances. &nbsp;Check out <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/04/business/leweb-parallax-internet-things/index.html?hpt=hp_c3">this fun animation on CNN</a> that explains well how connected objects are and will continue to impact our lives.</p>
<p>And now comes Loochi, the connected lamp.</p>
<p>The Franco-American rockstar&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/loochi?c=home">L-Team</a> has been developing prototypes of Loochi for the past 6 months to arrive at the current design, with the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 10-watt LED bulb (check out <a title="Switch Lighting.  Savings that will light you up." href="http://wattnow.org/1085/switch-lighting-savings-that-will-light-you-up">Switch Lighting</a> and <a title="Digital Lumens.  Intelligent lighting systems." href="http://wattnow.org/952/digital-lumens-intelligent-lighting-systems">Digital Lumens</a>&nbsp;to remind yourself of the efficient-awesomeness of LED lights) from <a href="http://www.ledengin.com/">LED Engin</a> producing 510 Lumen (more than the amount of light produced by a 40W incandescent bulb).</li>
<li>The base of the lamp, designed by Dr. Jurgen Kienhofer under a CC-BY-SA license, &nbsp;is made of plastic with a chrome plating, and an aluminum-based heatsink to cool the LED.</li>
<li>The Loochi is wirelessly connected via Blutooth&reg; 4.0 - intentionally not WIFI - to avoid complex connection issues and facilitate the user experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Loochi has countless applications - waking you up gently, linking notifications to light signals, synchronizing Loochi with your music for a party, and more.</p>

<p>Also, Loochi is completely open-source, so you can program your own applications or design and 3-D print your own lamp shade.</p>

<p>If you are as excited about the Loochi as I am, help support the team by crowdfunding and even <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/loochi?c=home">pre-ordering your Loochi NOW</a>. &nbsp;Orders go until January 6, 2013, and shipping is expected for March/April 2013.</p>
<p>I ordered mine last night and can not wait to smoochi my Loochi.</p>
