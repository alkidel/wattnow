<p><a href="http://greentownlabs.org/index.html">Greentown Labs</a> is a low-cost, clean-energy prototyping space for early stage cleantech entrepreneurs to "get dirty, bend metal, and make noise".</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/greentown-labs.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-753" title="greentown labs" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/greentown-labs.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a></p>

<p>The 14,000 ft2 - space is located in Boston's newly titled <a href="http://greentownlabs.org/pages/facility.html">Innovation District</a>&nbsp;and currently houses<a href="http://greentownlabs.org/pages/companies.html"> 10 start-up companies</a>.</p>
<p>I've actually written about 3 of them! &nbsp;And they are...</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="SolSolution.  Clean energy for education." href="http://wattnow.org/505/solsolution-clean-energy-for-education">SolSolution</a>&nbsp;- solar power and education funding for schools</li>
<li><a title="Promethean Power Systems" href="http://wattnow.org/201/promethean-power-systems">Promethean Power</a> - solar refrigeration for the Indian dairy industry</li>
<li><a title="Altaeros Energies" href="http://wattnow.org/95/altaeros-energies">Altaeros Energies</a> - low-cost airborne wind turbine technology</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of shared working space is not new, especially for web start-ups. &nbsp;But when you're talking green ventures, you're talking about a <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/print-edition/2011/08/05/technology-finds-a-home-at-greentown.html?page=all">whole new set of criteria for the required work space</a>&nbsp;-- in addition to ya know, a bunch of computers, a wall-size whiteboard, and a Wii console.</p>
<p>For instance, Altaeros needed 40-ft high ceilings to test their airborne turbines, another company required access to a south-facing area for solar panels, and a third needed high-capacity electrical service.</p>
<p>Despite these cumbersome specifications, Greentown Labs recognizes the value of shared working space, and it's more than just economics - as Jason Hanna, the managing director of Greentown Labs and founder of<a href="http://www.coincident.com/#welcome"> Coincident</a> (one of the 10 startups), puts it, the proximity provides</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"that universal collaboration that just happens when you put entrepreneurs together".</p>
