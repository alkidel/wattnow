<p style="text-align: justify;">Grid-scale adoption of renewables requires&nbsp;<strong><a title="energy storage" href="http://wattnow.org/wattnow-projects/energy-storage">energy storage</a></strong>. &nbsp;<strong>Cheap energy storage.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For instance, the cost of PV solar, approaching&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.solarbuzz.com/facts-and-figures/markets-growth/cost-competitiveness">$0.25/kWh</a></strong>, is becoming cost competitive with traditional baseload energy sources (gas, coal, nuclear, etc.), with production costs of about $0.05-$.015/kWh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But solar is intermittent. &nbsp;And to become "baseload", PV solar needs to be coupled with an electrical storage system. &nbsp;But existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage#Economics">storage solutions</a>&nbsp;are on the order of <strong>several dollars per kWh</strong>, plummeting the competitiveness of solar (and other intermittent renewables such as wind).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter Dr. Sadoway and his liquid metal battery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2111966,00.html"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2198" title="t100_sadoway" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/t100_sadoway.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="215" height="286" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Professor Donald Sadoway and <a href="http://sadoway.mit.edu/research/liquid-metal-batteries">his team at MIT</a> set about this energy storage challenge to&nbsp;create a battery that from the start, would be a) cheap and b) designed for the grid - in essence, a battery on the order megawatts (re. big!) that can resist high temperatures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadoway first went to the periodic table and found two elements, magnesium (Mg) and antimony (Sb) to serve as electrodes that matched his specifications - dirt cheap (literally) and good electrochemical properties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using these elements, Sadoway and his team designed a&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://sadoway.mit.edu/research/liquid-metal-batteries">liquid metal battery<strong><a href="http://sadoway.mit.edu/research/liquid-metal-batteries">&nbsp;(LMB)</a></strong></a></strong>, where the electrodes (magnesium and antimony) and the electrolyte (a molten salt) are heated to more than 700&deg;C, and due to density differences, the three melted liquids settle in three distinct layers, <a href="http://sadoway.mit.edu/research/liquid-metal-batteries">allowing low assembly costs</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And not only can this battery work in high temperatures as required for grid applications, it <em>needs</em>&nbsp;high temperatures to work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheap materials. &nbsp;Cheap assembly. &nbsp;Appropriate for the grid. &nbsp;What are we waiting for?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.treehugger.com/renewable-energy/grid-scale-metal-liquid-batteries-could-revolutionize-renewable-energy-use.html"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2199" title="Sadoway_chalkboard" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/Sadoway_chalkboard.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="492" height="289" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadoway's battery has been around since 2009, but it's been making headlines lately due to <strong><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/donald_sadoway_the_missing_link_to_renewable_energy.html">Sadoway's recent TED Talk </a></strong>&nbsp;- a hugely popular video with&nbsp;almost 600,000 views!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Sadoway explains in the video, his team has gone from a "shotglass" model of the LMB to the "16-inch pizza" which can store 1kWh of electricity - enough energy to power your space heater for about an hour. &nbsp;Ok, not that impressive but the next model, the 36-inch wide "Bistrot Table", will store enough energy to provide the daily electrical needs of 200 households - a battery that is&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2012/02/29/reinventing-the-battery-donald-sadoway-at-ted2012/">"silent, emissions free, has no moving parts, is remotely controlled, and is designed to the market price point, without subsidy"</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Awesome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I took <strong><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-091sc-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2010/">3.091</a></strong> (Introduction to Solid State Chemistry) with Professor Sadoway over 10 years ago. &nbsp;I remember clearly that he played a song for us at the beginning of each class, varying from the Rolling Stones to Mozart, which I loved. &nbsp;Sadoway was intense, sometimes intimidatingly so, but he was inspiring. &nbsp;And 10 years later, I am more inspired than ever by the liquid metal battery. &nbsp;And I am excited and hopeful to see the this technology go from the lab - to the grid.</p>
