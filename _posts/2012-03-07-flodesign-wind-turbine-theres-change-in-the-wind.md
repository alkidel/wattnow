<p>Waltham, MA-based&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fdwt.com/">FloDesign Wind Turbine Corp.</a>&nbsp;a spinoff of aerospace company <a href="http://flodesign.org/about.html">FloDesign</a>, has developed a novel compact jet-engine inspired wind turbine that is 3-4x more efficient and significantly cheaper to produce than existing turbines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fdwt.com/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1892" title="flodesign - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/flodesign-logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="349" height="85" /></a></p>
<p>From innovative airborne wind technologies like <a title="Makani Power.  High capacity wind." href="http://wattnow.org/1148/makani-power-high-capacity-wind">Makani Power</a> and <a title="Altaeros Energies" href="http://wattnow.org/95/altaeros-energies">Altaeros</a>, to kite technologies like <a title="SkySails.  New energy for shipping." href="http://wattnow.org/1480/skysails-new-energy-for-shipping">SkySails </a>to vertical wind systems as seen in the <a title="Wind-it.  Vertical wind turbines on existing tower networks." href="http://wattnow.org/1108/wind-it-vertical-wind-turbines-on-existing-tower-networks">Wind-It</a> project, to aerolastic-flutter designs such as <a href="http://wattnow.org/4/hummm">Humdinger</a>, FloDesign is not alone in challenging the classic 3-blade approach for harnessing wind power.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greendiary.com/entry/flodesign-wind-turbines-to-rise-above-concept-stage/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1895" title="flodesign - mountain" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/flodesign-mountain.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="462" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>Though FloDesign remains rather secretive about the technology (as witnessed by <a href="http://fdwt.com/">the minimalistic website</a>), we understand that the potentially groundbreaking technology is based on a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/energy/21737/">shrouded propulsion system</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, when air approaches the turbine, it first meets a set of fixed blades, called the stator, which then redirects the wind onto a set of movable blades, called the rotor. &nbsp;The air spins the rotor and emerges on the other side, moving more slowly than the air flowing outside the turbine. &nbsp;The shroud guides the fast-moving air to meet the slow-moving air to create a rapid mixing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex">vortex</a>, extracting more air.</p>
<p>FloDesign's turbine is more efficient at harnessing wind energy than traditional wind turbines which can convert at most 59.3% of wind's kinetic energy, a phenomenon known as the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz'_law">Betz limit</a>.</p>

<p>See the video below for a basic explanation of the technology.</p>

<p>Moreover, FloDesign's turbines are much smaller than traditional turbines, allowing for easier and cheaper manufacturing and transport. &nbsp;And, the turbines' compact size allow for them to be placed much closer together, enabling the deployment of the FloDesign turbines in a wider range of locations, including urban areas.</p>
<p>Created in 2008, FloDesign Wind Turbine Corp. raised over $50 million in funding within 18 months, including a <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov/ProgramsProjects/OtherProjects/RenewablePower/BreakthroughHighEfficiencyShroudedWindTurbine.aspx">$8.3 million grant from ARPA-E</a>.</p>
<p>FloDesign successfully tested a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqHipyQccKU&amp;feature=related">full-scale 100kW pilot turbine</a> on Deer Island in the Boston Harbor in 2011.</p>
<p>The next steps are unclear but this sort of ground-breaking technology - a system that is cheaper, more efficient, and more flexible than existing wind turbines, could help accelerate the deployment and acceptance of renewable energy sources.</p>
