<p>I&nbsp;was inspired to approach the topic of low-carbon travel, after reading&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.withouthotair.com/">Sustainable Energy - without the hot air</a>&nbsp;</strong>and realizing that no matter how much effort you make in your daily life to reduce your carbon emissions and live efficiently - take shorter showers, turn down the heat, avoid using a car, eat less meat - as soon as you step onto an airplane, all those nice "efforts" are sadly erased.</p>
<p>As author David MacKay explains, taking one intercontinental roundtrip flight (say London-Los Angeles) consumes<a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c5/page_35.shtml"> approximately 12,000kWh per person</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;about 30kWh/day for one year.&nbsp; To put that into perspective, that's like <strong>leaving your heater on 24/day every day for one whole year</strong>.&nbsp; And that's just <strong>one flight</strong>!&nbsp; If you had to pay that much energy in electricity bills, that'd be $1204 in the US ($2080 in France, and $3942 in Germany!).</p>
<p>What does that mean for expat globetrotters&nbsp;who love to travel and&nbsp;take (gulp) multiple intercontinental flights per year?&nbsp; Is there hope that airplanes will become more efficient?&nbsp; Unfortunately, not really.&nbsp; Aircraft manufacturers are looking to make planes lighter and to increase capacity, but airplanes will still remain gas guzzling beasts.</p>
<p>But what if -</p>
<p>we used the sun to power airplanes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2167" title="Solar_Impulse_flight" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/Solar_Impulse_flight.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="420" height="234" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/"><strong>Solar Impulse</strong></a>, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, is a solar power plane project founded in 2003 by Bertrand Piccard and Andr√© Borschberg, and financed by private companies (the four major partners are Solvay, Schindler, Omega, and Deutsche Bank).</p>
<p>Solar-powered planes do exist!</p>
<p>Solar Impulse's first aircraft, the <strong><a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/airplane/hb-sia/">HB-SIA</a>,</strong>&nbsp;is a prototype aircraft with 11,628 PV cells, a wingspan of 63.4 meters, a cruise speed of 70 km/hour, and a carrying capacity of 1 person.</p>
<p>Ok, so maybe an airplane that has the same wingspan as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A340">Airbus A340</a>, but goes slower than your grandmother driving and carries 1 measly person might not seem that impressive. &nbsp;But this is the "revenge of Icarus" - an airplane that can fly day and night without using fuel. &nbsp;This is huge!</p>
<p>Why can't the plan go faster and hold more people? &nbsp;The project's major design constraint is the weight and power capacity of the lithium polymer batteries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/multimedia/educational-material/"><img title="Solar_Impulse_panels" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/Solar_Impulse_panels.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="542" height="363" /></a></p>
<p>This being said, the HB-SIA successfully performed a 26-hour flight in July 2010, a 13-hour international flight in May 2011 (from Switzerland to Belgium), and in the upcoming weeks will perform a 2,500km, 48-hour journey from Switzerland to Morocco -- all being practice flights for a <strong><a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/tag/Crossing-Frontiers">round-the-world flight in 2014</a>&nbsp;</strong>with the upgraded <a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/airplane/hb-sib/">HB-SIB model</a>.</p>
<p>Solar Impulse recognizes that its solar plane project will not revolutionize the aviation industry in the near-term, but they hope to demonstrate that "progress is possible using clean forms of energy".</p>
<p><a href="http://www.solarimpulse.com/en/airplane/">"Our airplane is not designed to carry passengers, but to carry a message." Bertrand Piccard</a></p>
<p>I agree that Solar Impulse projects a strong message about the potential of renewable energies - but I am also optimistic (naive maybe?) that solar-powered commercial aviation could one day become a reality.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what should we do about flying? &nbsp;Try to take direct flights instead of flights with stops. &nbsp;Better yet, take a train instead if possible. &nbsp;Better yet, think twice about making the trip.</p>
<p>I know I know, that's sad.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts about the subject?</p>
