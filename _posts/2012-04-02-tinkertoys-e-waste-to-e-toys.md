<p style="text-align: justify;">Designer/engineer <a href="http://dhairyadand.com/works/about-cv-contact/">Dhairya Dand</a>&nbsp;is the brain behind <a href="http://dhairyadand.com/works/thinkertoys/">ThinkerToys</a>, an open-source project to recycle and convert electronic waste into fun, educational toys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/04/thinkertoys_logo.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2031" title="thinkertoys_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/04/thinkertoys_logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="431" height="285" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dand, a researcher at Singapore's Keio-NUS Cute Center and Mixed Reality Lab, developed the idea for <strong>ThinkerToys</strong> during a trip to Cambodia, where he witnessed a landfill site just outside of Phnom Penh brimming with mountains of electronic waste - and kids, working at the landfill instead of going to school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dand wanted to address the situation immediately, and started designing and building toys to tackle both issues: 1) recycle valuable e-waste, and 2) provide education toys for kids in areas of the world where e-waste is disposed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea is to create cheap (<$5) modular <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/thinkertoys-educational-toys-ewaste/21960/">"edutainment kits"</a> that can easily plug and play with typical e-waste products (PS/2 keyboards, mice, speakers, old CRT monitors, ...). &nbsp;Moreover, the kits are designed to require very simple manufacturing to allow for local production through basic fab-labs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ThinkerToys</strong> is still an early-stage project with but a handful of modular kits, but Dand plans to expand collaboration through <strong>openToys</strong>, an open-source community of designers and engineers, who can contribute to designing new ways to re-use e-waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dand will go back to Cambodia in May 2012 to launch pilot production in participation with a rural school, and test which kits are most popular. &nbsp;And&nbsp;"figure out the power problem - one solution is to have a single solar-based charging station in the village, where kids come charge their toys and play".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a> as a platform, here are some examples of edutainment kits that Dand has developed so far:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyano. &nbsp;</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Recycled Parts: PS/2 computer keyboard, small speaker (or headphones).</li>
<li>How it works: Each touch of the keyboard produces a different sound with the speaker, creating a novel recycled electronic improvisation piano.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Randomath.</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>Recycled Parts: PS/2 computer keyboard, LED screen.</li>
<li>How it works: The LED screen flashes mathematical puzzles which can be answered using the keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Storynory.</strong></li>
<ul>Recycled Parts: Speakers (or headphones).</ul>
<ul>How it works: Kids can listen to pre-recorded audiobooks, in the language local to the user.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
