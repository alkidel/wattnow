<p style="text-align: justify;">Rio de Janeiro-based designer Jo&atilde;o Lammoglia recently won a <a href="http://www.red-dot.sg/concept/porfolio/o_e/EG/B007.htm">Red Dot Design award</a> for his innovative face mask device baptized "<a href="http://www.joaolammoglia.net/#!products/photostackergallery0=0">AIRE</a>", which converts heavy breathing into usable electricity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.joaolammoglia.net/#!products/photostackergallery0=0"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1995" title="AIRE - product" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/AIRE-product.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="483" height="224" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The AIRE mask boasts an aesthetic that borders between cool -- and creepy. &nbsp;But if we manage to look beyond the Hannibal Lecter resemblance, the AIRE is an innovative product that renders renewable "wind" energy accessible and flexible for individuals - kind of like what <a title="B-Squares: Modular Solar Powered Electrics." href="http://wattnow.org/181/b-squares-modular-solar-powered-electrics">B-Squares</a> does for solar energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The AIRE mask contain tiny wind turbines which transform a person's breathing into electricity which is then transferred to electronic devices via a cable. &nbsp;The AIRE mask can be used indoors or outdoors, and Lammoglia claims the concept encourages physical exercise - the more heavily you breath, the more energy you produce. &nbsp;But the AIRE mask is equally impressive in that it can effectively be used during passive activities, like reading or sleeping.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.joaolammoglia.net/#!products/photostackergallery0=0"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1996" title="AIRE - use" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/AIRE-use.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="449" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The AIRE technology does not yet exist, and moreover, Lammoglia states that the point of the design was to stimulate others to come up with creative environmentally-friendly solutions to power the plethora of gadgets that have become permanent extensions of our being (re. smartphones).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Check out Lammoglia's other fascinating <a href="http://www.joaolammoglia.net/#!">sustainable designs</a>&nbsp;and the other <a href="http://www.red-dot.sg/concept/porfolio/o_e/EG.htm">Energy Red Dot Winners</a>&nbsp;for inspiring energy-related design projects.</p>
