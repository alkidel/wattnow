<p>Austin, Texas-based <a href="http://www.soldesignlab.com/index.html">Sol Design Lab</a>&nbsp;hits the street and brings people together with projects that combine art and sustainability.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-06-at-9.14.52-AM.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-638" title="Screen shot 2011-10-06 at 9.14.52 AM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-06-at-9.14.52-AM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="393" height="172" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coolest (or hottest*, rather) project coming out of Sol Design Lab is the <a href="http://www.soldesignlab.com/index.html">SolarPump Charging Station</a>, a solar-powered charging station for cell phones, electric bikes, scooters, and laptops.</p>
<p><em>*ugh, sorry for the bad pun. &nbsp;I can't help myself sometimes.</em></p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-06-at-9.25.31-AM1.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-640" title="Screen shot 2011-10-06 at 9.25.31 AM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-06-at-9.25.31-AM1-300x257.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="257" /></a> <a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-06-at-9.25.49-AM.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-641" title="Screen shot 2011-10-06 at 9.25.49 AM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/Screen-shot-2011-10-06-at-9.25.49-AM-300x281.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="281" /></a></p>


<p>Made mostly from recycled materials like reclaimed gas pumps, the SolarPump Charging Station also has a seating area,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.soldesignlab.com/about.html">designed to inspire conversation</a>&nbsp;about energy consumption, solar power, and electric vehicles.</p>
<p>The SolarPump Charging Station was first introduced at SXSW Eco 2010, and since then has appeared at festivals, conference centers, and universities around the world.</p>
<p>The general goal of Sol Design Lab is to <a href="http://www.soldesignlab.com/about.html">engage and educate people sustainable systems</a>. &nbsp;And seriously, what better way to do it than by bringing well-designed art technology to public spaces-- kind of like the BigBelly Solar&nbsp;<a title="BigBelly Solar.  Eliminating the Waste in Waste Collection." href="http://wattnow.org/158/bigbelly-solar-eliminating-the-waste-in-waste-collection">Litter Critters</a>&nbsp;in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>I found out about Sol Design Lab after reading through the schedule of talks at SXSW Eco 2011 and discovering&nbsp;<a href="http://sxsweco.com/speakers/bios/beth-ferguson">Beth Ferguson</a>, the founding director of Sol Design Lab. &nbsp;Beth and her CAD-expert partner Dallas Swindle seem like an awesome pair for leading awesome projects.</p>
<p>I'm super&nbsp;inspired.</p>
<p>Check out this fun video showing the charging station in action.</p>
