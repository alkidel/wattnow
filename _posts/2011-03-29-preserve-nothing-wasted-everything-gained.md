<p>On the topic of recycling plastics (see <a title="plastic bags are not recyclable!" href="http://alki.delichatsios.com/?p=55">previous post</a>), I recently discovered <a href="http://www.preserveproducts.com/">Preserve</a>, a Boston-based company that recycles #5 plastics (polypropylene or "PP") - which includes some yogurt containers, hummus tubs, ketchup bottles, caps, straws, ... plastics that until now, have rarely been recycled.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/preserve2.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-72 alignnone" title="preserve" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/03/preserve2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="331" height="106" /></a></p>
<p>Through its "<a href="http://www.preserveproducts.com/recycling/gimme5.html">Gimme5</a>" program (drop off sites at Whole Foods and other spots, or a mail-in option), Preserve collects #5 plastics and recycles them into products such as toothbrushes, razors, and kitchenware.&nbsp; And they've found a solution that is efficient and economical, such that they can sell their products at <a href="http://www.preserveproducts.com/products/kitchen.html">reasonable prices</a> and be profitable.</p>
<p>High 5 to Preserve!</p>
