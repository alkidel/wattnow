<p>Don't you hate when you print an excel file and you get 1 useful page of cells, and then 10 near-blank pages of random columns that you don't even care about?</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/printeco1.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-895" title="printeco" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/printeco1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="225" height="53" /></a></p>
<p>Headquartered in Chicago,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.printecosoftware.com/index.php">PrintEco</a>&nbsp;provides a set of plugins for your computer to optimize the content of documents you are printing in order to reduce printing costs - and your carbon footprint.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cb8rQWuEeVw" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>It may seem minor, but according to a study by Lexmark, <a href="http://www.greeninnovation.com.au/articles/LexmarkPrinterWasteStudy1.pdf">17% of annual company printing is wasteful</a>. &nbsp;And yes, it's best to avoid printing in the first place, but sometimes you gotta have that paper in front of you. &nbsp;In that case, ... Don't Just Print. &nbsp;PrintEco.</p>
<p>It's incredibly cheap too! &nbsp;For an individual, you get a free trial up to the first 100 pages saved, and then after that it's only $5 for the software. &nbsp;And the Office version (also ridiculously cheap at $11) includes analytics software so that a company can measure the financial and environmental impact of using PrintEco.</p>
<p>Seriously, if your company is looking for ways to "green" the officespace, I think you can't get a better value in terms of cost-simplicity-effectiveness than PrintEco.</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.treehugger.com/green-investments/printeco-wins-green-start-up-of-the-year-opportunity-green-conference.html">PrintEco recently won "Green Start-Up of the Year"</a> at the Opportunity Green conference in LA on Nov 10/11.</p>
<p>Right on!</p>
<p>Now, please make plugins for Chrome and Safari too.</p>
<p>(for the moment, the plugins are limited to Microsoft Office and Explorer)</p>
