<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/">Highview Power Storage</a>&nbsp;</strong>is a London-based startup developing a frozen air (or "liquid air") technology for grid-scale storage applications.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/10/highview-header2.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2424" title="highview header2" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/10/highview-header2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="451" height="85" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many interesting grid-scale storage technologies have cropped up in recent years including&nbsp;<a title="Sadoway&rsquo;s "dirt cheap" battery.  A solution for grid-scale renewables?" href="http://wattnow.org/2191/sadoways-dirty-cheap-battery-a-solution-for-grid-scale-renewables">liquid batteries</a>, <a title="LightSail Energy.  Regenerative Air Energy Storage." href="http://wattnow.org/1842/lightsail-energy-regenerative-air-energy-storage">compressed air storage</a>, <a title="Better Place.  Accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation." href="http://wattnow.org/859/better-place-accelerating-the-transition-to-sustainable-transportation">storage through electric vehicles</a>, <a title="A123.  Game changing energy storage solutions." href="http://wattnow.org/728/a123-game-changing-energy-storage-solutions">lithion ion</a>&nbsp;- and the need is clear: if we want successful integration of intermittent renewables (ie. solar, wind) in grid infrastructure, energy storage is a key component -- as well as a major challenge, as&nbsp;<a title="Sadoway&rsquo;s "dirt cheap" battery.  A solution for grid-scale renewables?" href="http://wattnow.org/2191/sadoways-dirty-cheap-battery-a-solution-for-grid-scale-renewables">we've already discussed</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/"><strong>Highview</strong></a> is commercializing the <a href="http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/?page_id=8">Cryo Energy System</a>&nbsp;and the<a href="http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/?page_id=438"> Cryo GenSet</a>, systems based on inventor <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/wind-technology/liquid-air-battery-could-provide-renewable-energy-storage.html">Peter Dearman</a>'s 50-year old idea to "store energy in cold".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 'frozen air' energy process begins during off-peak hours, when electricity generated by renewables is used to cool air down to -310F, turning the air from gas to liquid. &nbsp;The croygenic 'liquid air' is stored in a vacuum tank, and when electricity demand grows, the liquid air is warmed to ambient temperature, and the resulting increase in pressure drives a turbine for generating electricity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/?page_id=8"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2429" title="highview process 2" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/10/highview-process-2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="440" height="276" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Highview has built and successfully operated <a href="http://www.highview-power.com/wordpress/?page_id=227">a pilot at the Slough Heat &amp; Power station</a>&nbsp;since 2010, and they expect to build commercial-scale projects in the upcoming year.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Highview admits that the current process is only about 25% efficient, but once systems are produced at scale, the conversion could be up to <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/wind-technology/liquid-air-battery-could-provide-renewable-energy-storage.html">70% efficient</a>.</p>
