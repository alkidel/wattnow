<p><a href="http://elioth.com/en/2010/02/wind-it/">Wind-it</a>, a joint project between two Paris-based companies,&nbsp;<a href="http://elioth.com/">Elioth</a> and <a href="http://encoreheureux.org/">Encore Heureux</a>, is an innovative solution for superposing wind-turbines on existing power transmission and cell phone towers.</p>
<p><a href="http://elioth.com/en/2010/02/wind-it/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1109" title="wind-it" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/wind-it.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="445" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>I had a discussion recently with an employee of <a href="http://www.secondwind.com/index.html">Second Wind</a>&nbsp;about the wind industry - and how innovations in the industry are mostly incremental and not as exciting as projects we're seeing in the solar industry.</p>
<p>But Wind-it blows me away. &nbsp;Pun intended.</p>
<p>Wind blows harder at higher altitudes, so traditional wind turbines are usually built on very tall "pylons" (towers) generally made from rare metals.</p>
<p>The Wind-it concept is designed to build on existing transmission networks, expanding wind-generated electricity without the need for new tall pylons -- and in effect reducing rare metal needs, investment costs, and added visual pollution.</p>
<p>The idea is simple - install small vertical axis wind generators&nbsp;on existing pylons, coupled with wind guidance systems such as sails, reinforcing winds towards the generator. &nbsp;The electricity produced can then easily be re-integrated into the electrical grid.</p>
<p>Here-below is an example of a vertical axis wind generator, produced by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.urbangreenenergy.com/">Urban Green Energy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ecohomemagazine.com/Images/Urban-Green-Energy_tcm14-705560.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1110" title="UGE wind turbine" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/UGE-wind-turbine.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="230" height="355" /></a></p>
<p>Wind-it is targeting emerging countries, since pylons in these regions are growing at a fast rate for power transmission and cell phone towers -- a fact that was very evident for me when I was in <a title="NOKERO and En&egrave;ji Pw&ograve;p. Bringing solar-powered light to rural Haiti." href="http://wattnow.org/661/nokero-and-eneji-pwop-bringing-solar-light-to-rural-haiti">Haiti</a>, where even the remotest of villages are dotted with multiple new cell phone towers powered by diesel generators (that could eventually be replaced by Wind-it systems!).</p>
<p>But even in a country like France, if 1/3 of the existing pylons were retrofitted with Wind-it turbines, we could generate the equivalent electricity of <a href="http://elioth.com/en/2010/02/wind-it/">2 nuclear power plants</a>.</p>
<p>The Wind-it design was first developed in 2007, and since then, has received a European patent, is listed as one of <a title="The Blue Economy.  A new way of designing business." href="http://wattnow.org/898/the-blue-economy-a-new-way-of-designing-business">The Blue Economy</a> projects, and is currently being prototyped.</p>
<p>I love this idea of making a small change to an existing infrastructure to generate electricity - I'm curious to understand better the cost and time investment needed to integrate the Wind-it system, but theoretically (or I hope realistically!), we could be installing thousands of these tiny systems and producing wind-generated electricity within 2-3 years -- while highly political large-scale projects, like off-shore wind farms or nuclear plants, would still be in "discussion".</p>
