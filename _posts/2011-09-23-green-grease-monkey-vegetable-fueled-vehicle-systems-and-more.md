<p>What do you do with leftover cooking oil? &nbsp;You can't throw it down the drain. &nbsp;You're supposed to store it in a jar and then <a href="http://www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/ourservices/recyclingandtrash/curbsidecollections/getridofitright/foodandcookingoil.aspx">throw it safely in the trash</a>. &nbsp;Too bad you can't recycle it. &nbsp;Or can you? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.greengreasemonkey.com/">Green Grease Monkey</a>&nbsp;has found a clean and economic model to recycle cooking oil. &nbsp;Based in Jamaica Plain, MA, Green Grease Monkey converts diesel engines to run on Waste Vegetable Oil (WVO).</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-23-at-7.25.55-AM.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-479" title="Screen shot 2011-09-23 at 7.25.55 AM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-23-at-7.25.55-AM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="848" height="213" /></a></p>
<p>For restaurants or suppliers that produce large volumes of WVO, Green Grease Monkey will come pick up the oil free of charge. &nbsp;This avoids the WVO going to the landfills and also provides a cheaper solution for the restaurants as they usually have to <em>pay</em>&nbsp;to get rid of the stuff.</p>
<p>For drivers, Green Grease Monkey can convert an engine in <a href="http://www.greenwinwin.com/2010/07/pure-and-simple-green-grease-monkey.html">less than a day for about $1200</a>. &nbsp;Depending on how much your waste vegetable oil supplier charges (Green Grease sells it for $1.75/gallon, but most restaurants would happily give you their WVO away for free) and how much you drive, you can easily have a payback period of less than a year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, burning waste vegetable oil emits far fewer greenhouse gases and carcinogens than petroleum-based diesel.</p>
<p>Green Grease Monkey not only has a cool name, but provides a solution that is clean, cheap -- and everyone wins.</p>
<p>Yet another cool idea that is simple, small-scale but effective, and really create a "closed-system" (aka reusing goods instead of sending them to the dump). &nbsp;Restaurants should convert all their delivery vehicles to biodiesel - from french fries to roadtrippin' in one go! &nbsp;That would be the ultimate direct and optimized closed system for waste vegetable oil.</p>
