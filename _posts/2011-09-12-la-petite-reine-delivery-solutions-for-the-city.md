<p>There's so many cool things you can do with pedaling power. &nbsp;Like <a href="http://www.springwise.com/transportation/pedal-equipped-school-bus-powered-kids/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+springwise+%28Springwise%29">power a school bus</a>. &nbsp;Or <a href="http://globalcyclesolutions.com/">charge your cellphone</a>. &nbsp;Or <a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/bike-powered-sewing-machine-churns-out-bicycle-caps-for-nycs-new-museum/">sew a sweater</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lapetitereine.com/uk/index.php">La Petite Reine&nbsp;</a>is a French company that employs bicycle power to optimize the delivery of goods in dense urban communities.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/DSC05458.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-408" title="DSC05458" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/DSC05458.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="268" height="180" /></a></p>

<p>La Petite Reine developed the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lapetitereine.com/uk/ACHAT_vu.php?id_type=1&amp;id_niv1=5">Cargocycle</a>&nbsp;to overcome all the downfalls of a truck or van delivery in an urban setting - trucks are BIG (weighing over 1 metric ton), often way over-dimensioned (carrying less than 100kg of goods), and SLOW, especially in city traffic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lapetitereine.com/fr/ACHAT_vu.php?id_type=1&amp;id_niv1=5">Cargocycles</a>, weighing in at 100kg with a carrying capacity of 180kg, are not only better-dimensioned for city deliveries, they can maneuver and park much more easily, they are cheaper to operate, and best of all, they are much more environmental!</p>
<p>La Petite Reine has expanded beyond Paris to Bordeaux, Lyon, Rouen, Geneva, and even London! &nbsp;The Cargocycle is clearly an appropriate technology for dense cities, especially if there are lots of small and twisting streets that are truck-prohibitive, as many European cities are.</p>
<p>Could a system like this be appropriate for US cities, which tend to be more spread out and sprawling than European cities? &nbsp;Apparently, <a href="http://www.springwise.com/eco_sustainability/bline/">B-Line</a> seems to think so, offering tricycle cargo deliveries similar to La Petite Reine, in where else but... Portland!</p>
