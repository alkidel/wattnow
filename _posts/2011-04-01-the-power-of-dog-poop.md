  content: "There are alot of landfills nowadays which are using that emitted methane
    gas for a good purpose.  \r\n\r\nFor years now landfills have been required to
    cap the landfills and collect the methane gas (at least in the US, USEPA regulations),
    they would then  \"flare it off\", which is a fancy way of saying they would burn
    it so methane wasn't emitted.  Fortunately, a bunch of smart people realized this
    was stupid and decided to make a dollar off of it.\r\n\r\nA great example close
    to home for me is the University of New Hampshire's EcoLine project.  In an agreement
    with Waste Management Inc., they are piping methane gas from the local landfill
    to the university who uses it for cogenerateion (heating and electric needs).
    \ This project has reduced the Universities electric and heating bills by 80%!!!\r\n\r\nPoop
    power is all over the place nowadays and is becoming more and more practical;
    landfills, farms, and wastewater treatment facilites.  And you want to know the
    best part, the methanogenesis process used can turn all that poop into fertilizer!"

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://parksparkproject.com/home.html">The Park Spark Project </a>was started by conceptual artist Matthew Mazzotta interested in exploring the relationship between people and their environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The concept is simple and beautiful (...though maybe a bit stinky): convert dog poop into usable methane gas to power a lamp (or other uses -- they're open to ideas!) using an anaerobic methane digester.&nbsp; This principle is similar to that of <a title="Purpose Energy, Inc." href="http://alki.delichatsios.com/?p=27">Purpose Energy, Inc, </a>which I wrote about last week, which converts brewery waste into usable energy also using a methane digester.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site does a good job of <a href="http://parksparkproject.com/artwork/1206505.html">explaining in a really simple way </a>how it works, and why burning methane is better than just releasing it into the environment directly (as what happens when organic waste is disposed in a landfill).</p>
