<p>Based in Sioux Falls, South Dakota,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://peppermintenergy.com/">Peppermint Clean Energy</a></strong>&nbsp;is a cleantech startup developing the <strong><a href="http://peppermintenergy.com/how-it-works/">Forty2</a>,&nbsp;</strong>an integrated solar "Utility in a Box" - powerful enough to run an emergency disaster-relief medical facility, compact enough to be carried by a child.</p>
<p><a href="http://peppermintenergy.com/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2379" title="forty2_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/09/forty2_logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="412" height="136" /></a></p>
<p>The Forty2, with a name that pays homage to <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's&nbsp;</em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life.2C_the_Universe.2C_and_Everything_.2842.29">Answer of the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything</a><em>,&nbsp;</em>is a 2ft-by-3ft all-in-one unit that combines</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>power generation: 180-200W solar panels,</li>
<li>power storage: 350 watt-hour Lithium Ion battery, and</li>
<li>power inversion: an inverter with 3 built-in AC outlets.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://peppermintenergy.com/"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2380" title="forty2_sleek" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/09/forty2_sleek.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="420" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Forty2</strong> can be used for off-grid situations like camping, tailgating, and back-up power - large enough to run a small fridge, a HDTV, fans, laptops, multiple phones, a lot of LED lights, or some combination of the listed items.</p>
<p>More interestingly, the Forty2 could serve as a robust solution for portable electricity generation in developing countries in rural, unelectrified communities.</p>
<p>Integrated solar projects are already successfully addressing this market - like <a href="http://wattnow.org/2285/mera-gao-micro-grid-power-solar-powered-network-systems-for-rural-off-grid-villages">Mera Gao Power</a>'s solar microgrid, <a href="wecaresolar.org">We Care Solar</a>'s solar suitcase, and <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mikelin/readyset-solar-kit-for-ipad-iphone-android-and-mor?ref=live">ReadySet's</a> Solar Kit.</p>
<p>However, the Forty2 offers a unique combination of ultra-portability and high power that could be particularly useful for certain applications.</p>
<p>At ~$500 per system, the Forty2 is too expensive / over-dimensioned for a single household's needs, but could be interesting for a community of houses, a small business, or especially appropriate in emergency, health, and aid situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1408708524/the-forty2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2381" title="forty2_demo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/09/forty2_demo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>As a startup, Peppermint is looking for investors to <a href="http://ideamensch.com/brian-gramm/">raise capital</a>&nbsp;but also recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the beta production run of the first 250 units. &nbsp;The campaign has already raised $73,011 on &nbsp;(largely over the $25,000 goal) and still has 6 days to go.</p>
<p>Peppermint plans to sell the Forty2 domestically through their website and traditional retailers. &nbsp;For developing countries, Peppermint plans to partner with NGOs for distribution.</p>
<p>Portable. &nbsp;Powerful. &nbsp;And pretty sleek.</p>
