<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.solar-fuel.net/en/the-challenge/">SolarFuel</a>, a Stuttgart, Germany-based startup, is developing a Power-to-Gas (P2G) technology which converts wind and solar-generated electricity &nbsp;into "storable" synthetic CO2-neutral natural gas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.solar-fuel.net/en/home/home"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1977" title="SolarFuel - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/SolarFuel-logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="363" height="63" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The key challenge facing the successful integration of renewable sources (re. solar, wind) into grid infrastructure is&nbsp;<strong>intermittency</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Renewable electricity is generated irregularly - when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. &nbsp;Ironically, especially with respect to solar, panels are often most efficient when demand is lowest (during the day). &nbsp;And sometimes<em> too</em> much electricity is generated and can not be re-inserted into the grid, leading to a waste of electricity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Energy storage is therefore a key necessity to the adoption of renewables. &nbsp;However, as we have seen with projects like <a title="LightSail Energy.  Regenerative Air Energy Storage." href="http://wattnow.org/1842/lightsail-energy-regenerative-air-energy-storage">LightSail Energy</a>, storage technologies are currently prohibitively expensive to be used at grid-scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enter <strong><a href="solar-fuel.net">SolarFuel</a></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The traditional energy model uses gas to generate electricity. &nbsp;However, now that we have this "surplus" of renewable-generated electricity, SolarFuel has turned the classic energy model on its head -- to convert electricity into natural gas, which is efficient, CO2 neutral - and most importably, <strong>storable</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developed at ZSW and FraunhoferIWES, two German research centers, SolarFuel's process mimics photosynthesis to convert CO2 into usable fuel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, renewable-generated electricity is used to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second step is a methanation process which combines the separated hydrogen with ambient CO2 to produce methane (CH4), which can be used as directly as an automotive fuel (efficiency of 60%) or then reconverted into electricity, a process described as power to gas to power, or P2G2P (efficiency of 40%).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://ecosummit.net/award/eco12/startups/solarfuel"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1980" title="solarfuel_powertogas_620" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/solarfuel_powertogas_620.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="521" height="359" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SolarFuel's first customer, carmaker Audi, plans to offer CO2 neutral mobility by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Investing in four 3.6 MW offshore wind turbines,</li>
<li>Building a SolarFuel 6.3 MW P2G plant.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SolarFuel's plant will convert the wind-generated electricity into natural gas and will be operational in 2013, in time for Audi's new compressed natural gas car model, A3 TCNG.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all, SolarFuel's revolutionary P2G technology responds to the challenge of intermittency with a creative system that elegantly combines&nbsp;renewable energy, energy conversion, storage, and transportation.</p>
