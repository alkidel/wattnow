<p>London-based <strong><a href="http://www.pavegen.com/">Pavegen</a>&nbsp;</strong>builds energy-harvesting tiles based on a <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/kinetic-sidewalk-enlightening-feat-olympics.html">hybrid piezoelectric technology</a> that transform footsteps into electricity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pavegen.com/"><img title="pavegen_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/08/pavegen_logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="258" height="86" /></a></p>
<p>The technology is featured at the London Olympics, where 12 tiles have been installed at the West Ham tube station connecting to the Olympic Park. &nbsp;These tiles generate and store electricity (each has a small battery) in order to power 12 LED spotlights along the walkway during nighttime hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pavegen.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2335" title="Pavegen_westham_pedestrians_1" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/08/Pavegen_westham_pedestrians_1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="615" height="350" /></a></p>
<p>Pavegen <a href="http://www.pavegen.com/west-ham-dashboard.php">provides live feed of the energy created</a>&nbsp;at the West Ham installation in terms of footsteps and watt-hours. &nbsp;Each tile has a capacity of 6 watts, but in order to use the tile's full capacity, there needs to be a constant flow of about 50 steps / minute.</p>
<p>The reality is that the tiles are seeing about 5 steps / minute, and <a href="http://www.pavegen.com/west-ham-month.php">on a good day</a>, the kinetic sidewalk will generate about 75 watt-hours of electricity. &nbsp;This is equivalent to powering an old 60-watt incandescent lightbulb for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. &nbsp;Or six LED 60-W equivalents (at 10-W each) for the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Are the tiles generating enough electricity to power the walkway's spotlights?</p>
<p>The results might not seem that impressive, but the Pavegen system provides more than electricity - the technology also provides an interactive opportunity to engage people with sustainability and energy understanding.</p>
<p>Each tile is equipped with a small central light that is illuminated each time the tile is stepped upon, informing &nbsp;the walker that something is different about this tile than the cement next to it. &nbsp;This small central light consumes only 5% of the energy generated, the rest of which can be stored or used for other low-power applications.</p>
<p>Moreover, the tiles are made from recycled rubber (old "lorry" tires) and other recyclable materials.</p>
<p>The Pavegen technology is practical in areas with high foot traffic - metro stations, offices, schools, shopping centers - and is particularly useful were grid connections are not feasible. &nbsp;The power generated can be used to charge batteries or to power low-energy applications, such as street lamps, signs, alarms, or speaker systems.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Pavegen system does not seem commercially viable on its energy-generating capacity alone, but combined with the interactive potential, Pavegen is a pretty cool system.</p>
<p>Hopefully as the technology improves, it will be commercially viable and soon sidewalks around the world will be lined with Pavegen tiles. &nbsp;Due to its distributed nature, the Pavegen system could be particularly interesting for off-grid rural areas to power street lamps, especially if the materials could be resourced locally and the tiles could be manufactured locally.</p>
<p>And they've already tested the Pavegen technology with <a href="http://www.pavegen.com/energy-generating-dancefloor.php">dance installations</a>, but could you imagine if they installed Pavegen tiles in Dance Dance Revolution machines? &nbsp;There's one way to maximize the capacity of the tiles.</p>
<p>The options are endless.</p>
