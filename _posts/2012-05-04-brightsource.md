<p>When you hear solar power, you're probably thinking photovoltatics (PV) .&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="http://wattnow.org/wattnow-projects/solar">all but one*&nbsp;solar projects documented on Watt Now</a>&nbsp;have been PV technologies.&nbsp; And solar PV has dominated the media lately due to significant cost reductions in PV manufacturing&nbsp;and&nbsp;concern about China's control over the PV supply chain.</p>
<p>But there's another [very significant] solar player for generating electricity: <strong>Solar Thermal Electricity (STE),</strong> based on concentrated solar power technology, and often simply referred to as,&nbsp;<strong>CSP</strong>.</p>
<div class="mceTemp">
<p><a href="http://www.solarthermalmagazine.com/2010/06/02/largest-solar-thermal-energy-project-in-the-southern-hemisphere/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2133" title="areva-solar-thermal-farm-solar-thermal-magazine" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/areva-solar-thermal-farm-solar-thermal-magazine1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="450" height="240" /></a></p>
</div>
<p>Unlike PV, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics">converts solar energy directly into DC electric power</a>&nbsp;using semiconductor materials and the photoelectric effect, the basic principle of CSP is to use solar energy to heat water.</p>
<p>From there, the&nbsp;CSP system closely resembles a conventional power plant (re. coal, gas, nuclear):&nbsp;the&nbsp;hot water becomes high temperature steam to&nbsp;operate a turbine which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/">BrightSource Energy</a>&nbsp; </strong>is an Oakland, CA-based CSP "startup" that was founded in 2004, raised over $160 million in funding, and already has&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/the-story-behind-brightsources-ditched-ipo/">13 orders for solar thermal power plants </a>to be built between now and 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BrightSource's&nbsp;CSP design is a <a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/technology/how_lpt_works/">solar tower design</a>, where&nbsp;dual-axis rotating heliostats (mirrors) concentrate sun rays onto a central tower (boiler) which captures the heat and &nbsp;generates pressurized steam, which is then piped to a conventional steam turbine generator.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BrightSource was planning for an IPO this year in order to raise an additional $250 million in funding, but <a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/the-story-behind-brightsources-ditched-ipo/">recently withdrew the IPO </a>due to weak markets and decreasing (and therefore competing) costs from PV markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So does&nbsp;CSP really have a future if PV solar keeps getting cheaper and cheaper?&nbsp; The answer is, <strong>yes.</strong></p>
<p>PV solar and thermal solar are largely complimentary technologies,&nbsp;and where PV solar is modular, flexible, and can be built close to the consumer,&nbsp;CSP offers two major advantages over PV:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div >CSP-generated power <strong>can be stored</strong> as heat.&nbsp; See BrightSolar's <a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/technology/how_lpt_works/">SolarPLUS system.</a></div>
</li>
<li>
<div >CSP systems can easily be<strong> integrated into existing conventional plants</strong>, largely reducing investment costs.&nbsp;</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CSP systems are especially efficient in hot,&nbsp;arid, and semi-arid regions, and costs are going down as the industry matures.&nbsp; The&nbsp;International Energy Agency estimates that <a href="http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf">CSP technologies will be cost competitive</a>&nbsp;with conventional technologies for peak and intermediate loads by about 2020.</p>
<p>BrightSource expects its first commercial-scale project, <strong><a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/projects/ivanpah">Ivanpah</a></strong>, to&nbsp;start operations in 2013.&nbsp; Ivanpah, located in the Mojave desert, is a <strong>400-MW farm</strong> (the largest solar plant in the world currently under construction!),&nbsp;financed largely by NRG Energy and Google.</p>
<p>With BrightSource's substantial order backlog, and increasing engagement in CSP around the world (including 50 projects planned in Spain, and the ambitious&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertec">Desertec</a>&nbsp;</strong>project in North Africa) --</p>
<p><strong>CSP has a long future ahead.&nbsp; </strong></p>
