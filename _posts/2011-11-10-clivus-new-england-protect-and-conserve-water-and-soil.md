<p><a href="http://clivusne.com/index.php">Clivus New England</a>&nbsp;is the industry leader in composting waste treatment and greywater technologies.</p>
<p>I was at Walden Pond the other day, and after coming out of the public toilets, I saw this sign:</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/clivus.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img title="clivus" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/clivus-1024x764.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="448" height="334" /></a></p>
<p>That's right -- during that specific trip to the bathroom, I saved 97% of water (as compared to a conventional 1.6 gallon toilet flush) and contributed to a lovely pile of compost with my... valuable excrement. &nbsp;And without realizing it! &nbsp;And it didn't stink at all as you would expect from a non-flushing toilet.</p>
<p>Clivus's <a href="http://clivusne.com/science-and-technology.php">3-ounce Foam-Flush Nepon Toilet</a>&nbsp;separates urine from feces and uses aerobic mesophilic decomposition to break down the urine and feces into stable compounds within the composting system.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/clivus-building-design.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-766" title="clivus - building design" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/clivus-building-design.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="800" height="717" /></a></p>
<p>The separated urine is mixed with certain bacteria (Nitrobactor and Nitrosomonas) to convert the chemically unstable components (urea and ammonia) into a liquid end-product containing nitrite and nitrate, which is a valuable fertilizer. &nbsp;The Clivus system produces about 1 gallon of this liquid fertilizer for every 20 toilet uses, at which point the liquid is then pumped to a separate storage tank.</p>
<p>The separated feces reacts with organisms in the composter (including bacteria, fungi, and earthworms) in an aerobic environment, releasing carbon dioxide and water vapor, and producing an energy-rich dry end-product. &nbsp;The biological content of this dry end-product is similar to that of topsoil and is intended to be used as a fertilizer. &nbsp;Moreover, as feces is mostly water, the composting process reduces the volume by 90%!</p>
<p>Clivus also offers a greywater system which recycles water from sinks, showers, dishwashers, and washing machines to irrigate plants.</p>
<p>Clivus' waste treatment system is fantastic - not only is it hygenic (and does not smell bad), but the system saves (a lot of!) water, prevents nutrients in human waste from becoming a source of pollution, and makes usable fertilizer.</p>
<p>My only question is, why doesn't every home have one of these already?</p>
