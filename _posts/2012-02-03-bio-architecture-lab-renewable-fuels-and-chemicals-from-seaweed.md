<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.ba-lab.com/">Bio Architecture Lab (BAL)</a>, based in Berkeley, CA, has developed an enzyme to effectively breakdown <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed">brown seaweed</a>&nbsp;to produce ethanol.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/bal_lab_logo2.gif' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1731" title="bal_lab_logo2" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/bal_lab_logo2.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="200" height="105" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As compared to other biofuel feedstocks such as corn, macro-algae (as seaweed is more formally known):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>does not compete with food crops for arable land,</li>
<li>does not require freshwater, and</li>
<li>does not contain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignin">lignin</a> (a complex compound found in plant cells that is extremely difficult to break down).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, seaweed is sugar-rich, containing 60% fermentable carbohydrates -- and as BAL's co-founder and chief science officer, Yasuo Yoshikuni explains, <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/unlocking-seaweeds-next-gen-crude-sugar/">"Sugar is the next generation crude oil"</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Seaweed can yield 1500 gallons of ethanol per acre when farmed at 18-22 dry tons per acre. &nbsp;This yield rate is 50% more than sugar cane, and 3 times more than corn at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ba-lab.com/"><img class=" wp-image-1732" title="bal-seaweed" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/bal-seaweed.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="428" height="222" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why then, isn't seaweed fueling all our vehicles?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of the 60% fermentable carbohydrates found in seaweed, about half is composed of a sugar called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alginic_acid">alginate</a>. &nbsp;Alginate, like lignin, is difficult for existing microbes to metabolize, making it currently uneconomical to use seaweed as a feedstock for biofuels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BAL's genetically engineered strain of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">Escherichia coli bacterium</a>&nbsp;(E. Coli) however, successfully metabolizes alginate, rendering seaweed a huge potential feedstock for renewable fuels and chemicals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With over 60 patents or patents pending, BAL operates three seaweed farms in Los Lagos, Chili, and is building an <a href="http://www.ba-lab.com/pdf/BALPilotFacility.pdf">experimental pilot facility</a>, to be operational in 2012, which will &nbsp;demonstrate the complete value chain of the <a href="http://www.ba-lab.com/technology.php">technology</a>, from feedstock to biofuel production.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BAL has raised $37.5 million, including $8.8M from ARPA-E and $7.5 from Chile's economic development agency, Innova CORFO.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BAL expects to be operate commercially for renewable chemicals by 2014 and fuel within 5 years.</p>
