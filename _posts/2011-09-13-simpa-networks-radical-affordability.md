<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://simpanetworks.com/">Simpa Networks</a>, based in Bangalore, India, provides affordable access to solar energy through a "pay as you go" system for using and eventually purchasing solar home systems (SHS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/simpanetworks.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-419 alignnone" title="simpanetworks" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/simpanetworks.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="940" height="198" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fact is - over 2 billion people in the world have unreliable access to electricity, and the majority of these people rely on kerosene for light. &nbsp;Kerosene is dirty, inefficient, presents health risks, and ultimately, is very expensive with its high operating costs. &nbsp;However, the advantage of kerosene is its low initial cost and its usage flexibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Small-scale solar home systems are much more appropriate than kerosene for meeting the needs of the consumers at the "base of the economic of the pyramid" (BoP) - however, the upfront cost ($200-400) is the limiting factor in widespread usage of these systems. &nbsp;Though SHS systems are also undoubtedly more economical in the long-term than kerosene (over the 10-year life of an SHS system, a household would spend about $1500-2000 on equivalent costs for kerosene lighting), households simply can not afford the high upfront cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simpa Networks has developed a solar solution with an innovative&nbsp;<a href="http://simpanetworks.com/our-solution/">pricing model</a>&nbsp;to compete with kerosene products. &nbsp;With Simpa Networks' Progressive Purchase technology, the consumer makes a prepayment for a certain quantity of kWh which unlocks the solar home system. When the payment has run out, the system is disable until a new prepayment is made. &nbsp;Once the consumer has fully paid the total price of the product, the system is permanently unlocked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As they put it, "mobile phones are the great leapfrog story of the past decade. &nbsp;distributed solar is next".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And I totally agree. &nbsp;In order for the BoP to have widespread adoption of clean and reliable energy, we need to think differently about the economics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And clearly, Simpa Networks is doing just that.</p>
