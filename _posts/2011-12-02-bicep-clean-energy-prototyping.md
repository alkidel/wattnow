<p><a href="http://thegreenlightdistrikt.com/2011/10/24/the-plan-to-make-boston-the-leading-city-for-clean-energy-prototyping/">BICEP</a>, the Boston Institute for Clean Energy Prototyping, is (or will soon be) a non-profit helping cleantech startups develop and build prototypes.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/bicep1.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-946" title="bicep" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/bicep1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="351" height="144" /></a></p>
<p>The problem is simple. &nbsp;Small cleantech startups will often start with a good idea -- but not a lot of money. &nbsp;In order to get money from VCs and other funding sources, a startup usually needs a prototype to prove the idea. &nbsp;Not only do prototypes cost a lot of money, but engineers/founders often have no idea what they're doing when it comes to building a prototype.</p>
<p>Ethan Labowitz recognized this issue and created BICEP to help startups reduce prototyping time and costs through:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discounted shop services (training, fab, consulting)</li>
<li>Free office hours</li>
<li>Short intensive workshops through its "Cleantech Prototyping Academy"</li>
</ol>
<p>BICEP will be a 501c3 and seek donations/grants from organizations and government agencies that see value in Boston becoming a cleantech prototyping hub. &nbsp;This will allow BICEP to provide its services to startups for free or at minimal prices. &nbsp;The aim is to be transparent and share lessons learned to further bring down costs and time to build prototypes, and ultimately&nbsp;<a href="http://thegreenlightdistrikt.com/2011/10/24/the-plan-to-make-boston-the-leading-city-for-clean-energy-prototyping/">"make Boston the best place in the country to prototype a clean energy product"</a>.</p>
<p>Right on!</p>
<p>Ethan Labowitz is also the shop manager of&nbsp;<a title="Greentown Labs.  Get dirty, bend metal, and make noise." href="http://wattnow.org/752/greentown-labs-get-dirty-bend-metal-and-make-noise">Greentown Labs</a>&nbsp;where I met him at the <a href="http://energybarboston.eventbrite.com/">Energy Bar event</a> co-hosted by the Greentown Labs and the <a href="http://thegreenlightdistrikt.com/">Green Light Distrikt</a>, an awesome energy blog.</p>
