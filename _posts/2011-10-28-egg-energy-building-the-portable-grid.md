<p><a href="http://egg-energy.com/">EGG-energy</a>&nbsp;is a for-profit social enterprise, targeting the off-grid market in Tanzania to provide a battery subscription service. &nbsp;As they put it, EGG-energy is the "netflix" of power.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/egg-energy.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-full wp-image-687 alignnone" title="egg-energy" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/10/egg-energy.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="307" height="106" /></a></p>
<p>86% of the population in Tanzania is not connected to the grid. &nbsp;Ironically, of those 35 millions without electricity, 80% live within 5km of the grid. &nbsp;EGG-energy's netflix model bridges that gap.</p>
<p>What's so special about getting electricity from the grid? &nbsp;Basically, for those not connected to the grid, a typical household spends about $165 per year on kerosene for lighting, disposable batteries for radio and mobile phone charging services. &nbsp;That adds up to more than 10% of the household's income. &nbsp;Let's say you make $50,000 per year. &nbsp;Could you imagine spending over $400 per month on electricity? &nbsp;The more I learn about these rural areas with less developed infrastructure, the more I realize how expensive it is to be poor (as the CEO<a href="http://www.echoinggreen.org/fellows/jamie-yang"> Jamie Yang</a> put it nicely).</p>
<p>With EGG-energy's battery service, the customer can either pay a lower annual subscription fee and then a small fee each time he/she swaps a depleted battery, or, pay a higher subscription fee and get free unlimited swapping (which customers appear to prefer).</p>
<p>When we say batteries, we're not talking AA. &nbsp;We're talking about a solid brick-size battery that will last 5 nights and power a household's lighting, radios, and phone charging. &nbsp;Robust enough to power your house or small business - light enough to carry with one hand and exchange on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>EGG-energy offers its customers comprehensive electricity services at a much lower price than current expenditures. &nbsp;Moreover, <a href="http://egg-energy.com/what-we-do/clean-power/">by replacing kerosene and wasteful disposable batteries</a>, this battery netflix model not only expands access to electricity, but provides a cleaner and more efficient solution.</p>
<p>As of April 2011, EGG-energy has two&nbsp;<a href="http://egg-energy.com/about-us/locations/">charging stations&nbsp;</a>(via grid connection) in Chanika and Mbagala, both on the outskirts of Dar es Salaam. &nbsp;EGG-energy also partners with "contracted distributors", existing store owners who agree to swap EGG batteries in addition to normal activities in order to earn more revenue. &nbsp;Each charging site has five associated distribution sites, allowing end-user customers to easily access the batteries even at far distances from the charging sites. &nbsp;EGG-energy also started a solar pilot in Msanga (a rural village 100km from Dar es Salaam) and is working with an Iringa entrepreneur (5ookm from Dar es Salaam) to set up an on-grid franchise in the village.</p>
<p>This model is fantastic and obviously addresses the similar challenge of energy poverty that EarthSpark is addressing in Haiti. &nbsp;EarthSpark's current equivalent solution to EGG-energy's battery model is distributing <a href="http://barefootpower.com/barefoot-products/powapack/powapack-15w">Barefoot Power's 15W Solar Home System</a> to the off-grid market in Haiti.</p>
<p>The solar home system includes a similar battery to the one EGG-energy distributes. However, instead of charging the battery remotely, the battery is charged directly at the house with the 15W solar panel provided in the solar home kit. &nbsp;The added advantage of this sort of system is that the customer is autonomous and the battery is charged directly at his or her house. &nbsp;But I imagine this advantage most likely comes at an added cost as compared to the EGG-energy solution.</p>
<p>In any case, the EGG-energy model is an exciting solution to providing cheaper and cleaner electricity to the off-grid market in Tanzania.</p>
<p>My only question - is if households in Tanzania are so close to existing grid infrastructure, why not just extend the grid or make "micro-grids"? &nbsp;Is this too cost-prohibitive?</p>
<p>Update (Nov 2):</p>
<p>EGG-Energy's Blandine Antoine responded to my question with the following:</p>
<p>"Upfront capital expenditure is much higher; since government will not pay for it, end-customers would have to; upfront costs would be in the several thousands of dollars to get the lines to a single house."</p>
<p>'Nuff said. &nbsp;Great work, EGG-Energy!</p>
