<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/?i=coco_int.en.home">COCO-MAT</a>, based in Athens, Greece, makes idyllic mattresses using 100% natural raw materials from sustainable sources. &nbsp;Moreover, COCO-MAT does not use metals nor chemicals, and&nbsp;during the manufacturing process, COCO-MAT recycles 96% of waste products (re. converting leftover coco fibre into slippers).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/?i=coco_fr.en.home"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1776" title="coco-mat-logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/coco-mat-logo-300x99.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="99" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"If there is a purpose in nature, it is not to serve mankind, but to ensure the perpetual reproduction of all."&nbsp;<em>Theophrastos, 371 B.C.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This ancient philosophy drives COCO-MAT's mission to use sustainable techniques and rely on raw, natural materials instead of synthetic or artificial substitutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/?i=coco_fr.en.home"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1779" title="coco-mat - idyllic2" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/coco-mat-idyllic2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="645" height="343" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to create the ultimate healthy and comfortable experience for when you fall under the spell of Morpheus, the specific materials that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/resources/pdfs/EN%2CES%2CFR_Retail%20Catalogue%202010/#/21/zoomed">COCO-MAT uses</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;coconut fibre, horsehair, natural rubber, linen, seaweed, wool and cotton, goose down, and cactus fibres.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These material are chosen for their various qualities - elasticity, durability, humidity absorption, temperature control, ventilation, and in the case of seaweed, traces of iodine and other natural elements are present, providing protection against allergies, asthma, and respiratory problems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">COCO-MAT makes furniture (all-wood) as well as sleep products, and names all product lines after ancient Greek legendaries, including <a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/?i=coco_fr.en.sleep-products&amp;id=13&amp;m=309">Pythagoras</a>, <a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/?i=coco_fr.en.sleep-products&amp;id=2&amp;m=191">Afroditi</a>, and even <a href="http://www.coco-mat.com/?i=coco_fr.en.furniture&amp;id=132&amp;m=200">Alkistis</a>&nbsp;(who <a title="about" href="http://wattnow.org/about">I'm named after</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the product materials, COCO-MAT applies eco-efficiency to all aspects of the product life cycle, from manufacturing (the factory is based locally in Athens and uses no chimneys) to packaging (mattresses are transported in cotton cases). &nbsp;COCO-MAT has implemented Quality Management and Environmental Management systems, based on <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_9000_essentials">ISO 9001:2001</a> and <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_14000_essentials">ISO 14001 </a>requirements, and recently won the Total Quality Management award in 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COCO-MAT was founded by by the Evmorfidis brothers&nbsp;in 1989 in Athens, Greece and now, twenty years later, COCO-MAT has a wide international presence with 70 stores in 11 countries -- in fact, today 30% of sales are Chinese customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/the-way-greeks-live-now.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">New York Times</a> describes, COCO-MAT "defies the crisis in [Greece] in both its efforts and its formula for success". &nbsp;At a time where 1/4 of Greek companies have gone out of business since 2009 and unemployment for those under 25 is reaching 50%, COCO-MAT continues to succeed and even opened 5 new stores in Greece in 2011 alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Can COCO-MAT, with a business model based on local, natural, and sustainable practices, be a solution model for Greeks to overcome this crisis?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And let's remember, the current crisis is not just economic, it's also an identity and value crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The past decade has been confusing for Greeks - values have been somewhat jolted by joining the Euro, being enticed by over-consumerism, and educated young adults leaving the country for more finance-driven opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In particular, Greeks have maybe lost a bit of sight of their country's natural way of life. &nbsp;Greece boasts natural value that most other countries do not - 300 days of sunshine, and a climate and land incredibly rich in delicious and quality resources. &nbsp;COCO-MAT values this richesse, emphasizing its use of Greek natural materials, including wool from Thrace and seaweed from Sparta.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fortunately, many Greeks, in particular educated young Greeks, are starting to (re)recognize&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/world/europe/amid-economic-strife-greeks-look-to-farming-past.html?pagewanted=all">the wealth in Greece's natural way of life</a>&nbsp;during this difficult time. &nbsp;If these young entrepreneurs adopt a similar philosophy to COCO-MAT, one which promotes sustainability and Greece's natural wealth, maybe they too, will have a similar success. &nbsp;And then, we could all sleep a bit more soundly - on a bed of seaweed and coco fibres.</p>
