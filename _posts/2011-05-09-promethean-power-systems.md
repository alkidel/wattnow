<p>The market: Dairy industry in India.</p>
<p>The product: A hybrid-powered milk chiller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coolectrica.com/index.php">Promethean Power Systems</a> is a for-profit entreprise aimed at cold-chain food distribution in emerging markets.&nbsp; They spent a month in India doing exhaustive market research to best design their product, so it might sound obscure, but it sounds like they know what they're doing.</p>
<p>The idea is simple and elegant:</p>
<p>1. Take a system that is ineffecient and expensive => <strong>A conventional bulk milk cooler</strong> (which depends on a mix of grid power and a backup diesel generator)</p>
<p>2. Optimize the system by working all angles, a) improving the cooling system, and b) design an appropriate hybrid energy source - in this case, a mix of solar and grid power with a "thermal battery" (to store "cold energy").&nbsp; On top of that, add a <a href="http://www.coolectrica.com/content_solarpower.php?technology">"hybrid-power optimizer"</a>, a control unit that runs the entire system, and minimizes energy consumption and optimizes the use of solar and grid power.&nbsp; => <strong>Promethean's design!</strong></p>
<p>It's efficient, cheaper, and better for the environment.&nbsp; Win-win-win.&nbsp; I like it.</p>
<p>I'm interested to see where they go from here.&nbsp; Very very "cool".</p>
