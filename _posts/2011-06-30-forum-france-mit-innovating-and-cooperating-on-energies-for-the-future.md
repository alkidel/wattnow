<p>That's right.&nbsp; MIT signed a <a href="http://www.mit-france-energies.com/?IdNode=14434&amp;CurrentNode=14435&amp;Lang=GB&amp;KM_Session=316101390c0aedf0cf19f565385fcb8d">cooperation agreement </a>on the subject of energy with ... FRANCE!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://web.mit.edu/misti/mit-france/">MIT-France program</a> organized a day of lectures and round-tables yesterday, with speakers from both MIT and various French institutions to discuss energy policy, energy for the future, and more specifically, innovative materials for energy.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/06/mit-france-forum.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-265" title="mit-france forum" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/06/mit-france-forum.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="348" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>The day concluded with a cooperation agreement signed by Susan Hockfield (president of MIT) and Alain Fuchs (director of CNRS) to built a joint R&amp;D laboratory to develop materials for energy -- all in the presence of Valérie Pécresse, French Minister of Higher Education and Research.&nbsp; Not bad!</p>
<p>I made it to the morning session of talks with speakers including Ernie Moniz (director of MIT Energy Initiative), Suzanne Berger (MIT professor and director of MIT-France), and Martha Heitzmann (VP for Research and Innovation of AREVA).</p>
<p>The talks I saw were about innovation and energies of the future, and though they were quite interesting, I found myself deeply frustrated by many of the re-occurring themes that render this "global energy system" so complex&nbsp; --- national and international policy, special interest, economics, heavy industry, government, subsidies, resources, R&amp;D, investment, funding, manufacturing, ...</p>
<p>Clearly, this high-level debate needs to exist and continue, but once again, I find myself looking more towards "shifting the paradigm" as Martha Heitzmann alluded to in her talk.&nbsp; Is there another way we can look differently at the energy system?&nbsp; Bring it more to a simple individual or community level as opposed to this massive complex glob of technico-socio-politico MADNESS!?</p>
<p>What I mean is, --&nbsp; the top-down strategy is necessary -- but very complicated and slow-moving.&nbsp; I want to be part of a parallel movement, where we approach the issue from the bottom -- educating individuals about energy-use and building individual and local energy networks.......</p>
<p>On another note, of the speakers I saw, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/polisci/people/faculty/suzanne-berger.shtml">Suzanne Berger</a> particularly impressed me (I always like when I'm in inspired by cool, smart, and interesting women!).&nbsp; She chose to focus on an interesting point - that over the past 30 years, the "innovation culture" was dominated by IT and internet products and services.&nbsp; An industry that on the one hand, values design expertise and on the other hand, commoditizes manufacturing.&nbsp; As a result, in the US, companies like Apple, Intel, and Cisco boomed, they transferred their manufacturing to Asia.&nbsp; Professor Berger gave the example that for an iPhone that costs $600, only ~$7 goes to the manufacturing in Asia.&nbsp; Therefore, the majority of the wealth stays in the US.</p>
<p>Over the next 30 years, we will need major innovations in the energy industry.&nbsp; However, the energy industry, unlike the IT industry, sees a much larger portion of the "wealth" in manufacturing. This reality has already been demonstrated by the course of the solar industry in the US.&nbsp; While US companies have been at the forefront of designing and developing solar technologies, manufacturing was once again outsourced to Asia.&nbsp; And now, we are coming  to realize that the center of gravity for the solar industry is shifting  to China -- because manufacturing is not a "commodity" in the energy industry.&nbsp; Apparently, President Hockfield requested that Professor Berger lead an interdisciplinary team to work on this subject, a 2-year project titled <a href="http://web.mit.edu/polisci/research/pie.shtml">Production in the Innovation Economy</a>.</p>
<p>While we're talking about manufacturing (and the bottom-up approach), here is a cool article about bring manufacturing back -- and on a DIY and community-based level : <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/magazine/the-kitchen-table-industrialists.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;emc=eta1">The Kitchen Table Industrialists</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of straying ideas in this article.&nbsp; MIT - France cooperation.&nbsp; The "lourdeur" of the global energy industry.&nbsp; Working from the bottom up instead of top-down.&nbsp; Smart women.&nbsp; Innovation.&nbsp; Small-scale manufacturing.&nbsp; I'll try to be more focused next ti-- did I tell you that the 1BOG guy called me about a solar promo ?&nbsp; ;-)</p>
