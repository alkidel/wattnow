<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.waste2watts.org/">Waste2Watts</a>, based in Atlant, GA, is a for-profit social entreprise with a mission to address energy poverty in the developing world by <strong>creating innovative products from repurposed electronic waste</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.waste2watts.org/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1070" title="waste2watts" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/waste2watts.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="235" height="84" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">W2W's flagship product is <a href="http://www.waste2watts.org/wp/the-enzi/">the ENZI interface</a>, a low-cost Uninterruptible Power Supply, manufactured using a recycled computer power supply or power cord coupled with a recycled car battery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ENZI interface responds to two issues:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Power outages in developing countries. &nbsp;Power outages are a daily fact of life for 100s of millions of people. &nbsp;Power outages are obviously annoying - but beyond annoying, they become especially critical in situations like hospital operations. &nbsp;The ENZI is a cheap and simple solution to provide hours of backup power during an unexpected power outage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Proliferation of e-waste. &nbsp;Every year, 400 million units of electronic waste are discarded, representing only 2% of landfill waste by mass, but <strong>up to 70% of the hazardous heavy metals. &nbsp;</strong>The ENZI is a great solution for not only redirecting electronic waste from landfills, but building something new out of that dangerous but valuable waste - kind of like <a title="Free Geek.  Recycle computer technology." href="http://wattnow.org/722/free-geek-recycle-computer-technology">Free Geek</a>'s solution for e-waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">W2W plans to launch operations in India in 2012 and establish a local and sustainable solution through the development of micro-franchise product factories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">W2W has a ways to go before scaling up the ENZI and creating an efficient way of collecting e-waste ... but I'm already wondering what other products they have up their sleeves beyond the ENZI.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, I get really excited about both recycling and energy - but there's nothing I love more than combining the two. &nbsp;Waste2Watts. &nbsp;Right on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here's a comprehensive video explaining the history, product, and business model of the ENZI project.</p>
