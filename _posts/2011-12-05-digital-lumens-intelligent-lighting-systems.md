<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.digitallumens.com/">Digital Lumens</a>, based in Boston, MA, combines LEDS, networking, and software to create the first <strong>Intelligent Lighting System</strong> for industrial and commercial customers, <strong>reducing lighting energy needs by up to 90%</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.digitallumens.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-953" title="Screen Shot 2011-12-05 at 9.07.16 AM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-05-at-9.07.16-AM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="235" height="99" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital Lumens is driving lighting efficiency two-fold through:</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Ultra-efficient lighting technology (LEDS), and</li>
<li>Intelligent system management.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I first discovered the magic of LED lighting when I was <a title="NOKERO and En&egrave;ji Pw&ograve;p. Bringing solar-powered light to rural Haiti." href="http://wattnow.org/661/nokero-and-eneji-pwop-bringing-solar-light-to-rural-haiti">working in Haiti</a>, where all the solar-powered lamps we were distributing used LED technology as the lamp component. &nbsp;For instance, Barefoot Power's <a href="http://barefootpower.com/barefoot-products/powapack/powapack-15w">15W solar system</a> provides a tube light for room lighting (or "whole-house lighting" in Haiti where houses are typically designed such that the four rooms all share one ceiling) that was <em><strong>only 6W.</strong></em>&nbsp; And this tube light was much brighter than your typical 60W incandescent bulb.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, I confirmed with the DOE's EERE (Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energies) website that LED lights can be<strong><a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/ssl/sslbasics_ledbasics.html"> 10x more efficient than incandescent lights</a></strong>!</p>

<dt class="wp-caption-dt"><a href="http://barefootpower.com/barefoot-products/powapack/powapack-15w"><img class="size-medium wp-image-954" title="barefoot" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/barefoot-300x215.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></a></dt>
<dd class="wp-caption-dd">The long tube light (on the left) is only 6 WATTS!</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And not only are they more efficient, but LEDS last much longer than incandescent (by a factor of 50) and CFL lights (by a factor of 5), are more compact, are directional, don't contain mercury, and switching them on and off does not ruin LED life-expectancy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This last point is key for Digital Lumens' second design feature - an <a href="http://www.digitallumens.com/why-digital-lumens/intelligent/">intelligent system</a>. &nbsp;Digital Lumens' system manages when the lights go on, how brightly they shine, how long they stay on, and when they go off.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As Brian Chemel, co-founder and CTO of Digital Lumens puts it in the interview below, its the intelligence management and being able to turn the lights on and off quickly and precisely -- that drives the project payback with Digita Lumens' systems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Efficient. &nbsp;Specific. &nbsp;Smart and quick to implement. &nbsp;Awesome. &nbsp;Light the way, Digital Lumens!</p>
