<p><a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/">Recyclebank</a>, based in NYC, partners with hundreds of companies worldwide (including Coca Cola, Kashi, Brita) in creating a platform for consumers to</p>
<p>a) take small actions like a <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/how-to-earn/learnandearn/suave-learn-earn-4648/">quiz about water consumption</a> or a pledge to <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/how-to-earn/pointscodes/earn-points-codes-3230/">recycle your Kashi cereal boxes</a>, and</p>
<p>b) be rewarded for the actions with awesome deals like <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/reward/20-off-1197">20% off shoes.com</a> (100 points), <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/reward/2-off-any-brita-bottle-4482">$2 off a Brita bottle</a> (30 points), or ... let's be honest, I'd probably go for the <a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/reward/one-free-small-mccafe-smoothie-any-flavor-4350">Free Small McCafe Smoothie from McDonald's</a> (100 points).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.recyclebank.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-788" title="Screen Shot 2011-11-14 at 1.40.42 PM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-14-at-1.40.42-PM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="301" height="85" /></a></p>

<p>I admit, I was a bit skeptical of this idea at first - mainly because I find the concept of coupons and rebates quite annoying and stressful even. &nbsp;And not the most positive way to "incentivize" people to be more environmentally-conscious.</p>
<p>But - after joining and spending less than 15 minutes on the site, I'm hooked. &nbsp;I've learned about Q-tips being compostable, and how much money and energy I can save based on my shower habits, ... and I already have 90 points!</p>
<p>The magic of Recyclebank - is that they make it a game.</p>
<p>"Across the country, incentive experts at Recyclebank are using the power of gamification to radically improve home environmental compliance"&nbsp;- Mashable.</p>
<p>It's so true.</p>
<p>Building on this gaming notion, Recyclebank has hosted a series of community challenges that they refer to as "gaming for good", such as the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/22/business/media/recyclebank-seeks-to-school-consumers-on-environment.html?_r=2">Green Your School Year Challenge</a>, to encourage people to do green actions through competition. &nbsp;"There is a social and emotional bond when members interact with each other and get badges and points," says Javier Flaim, senior VP for global marketing.</p>
<p>This idea of engaging consumers through games and competition is powerful, as we also saw with <a title="Opower.  A new experience for utility customers." href="http://wattnow.org/772/opower-a-new-experience-for-utility-customers">Opower</a>&nbsp;who is partnering with Facebook to create a platform for consumers to compare and compete with regards to energy consumption and utilization.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's incredibly easy. You learn a lot. &nbsp;Quickly. &nbsp;And you get cool rewards. &nbsp;Join me on Recyclebank!</p>
<p>(and let's see who can get to 1000 points faster...)</p>
