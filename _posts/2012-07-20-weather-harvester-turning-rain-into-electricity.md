<p>Canadian Raymond Wang is developing a roof-mounted system based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity">piezoelectric</a> technology (converting mechanical stress into electricity) in order to harvest energy from rain, hail, and snow and convert it into useful electricity.</p>
<p>Did I mention that "Weather Harvester" is not a company, but the name of a science fair project?</p>
<p>Oh yes, and did I mentioned that <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/geek-life/profiles/14yearold-student-turns-rain-into-electricity/?utm_source=techalert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=071212">Raymond is 14-years-old</a>?</p>

<p>If you're impressed by Raymond, check out <a href="http://wattnow.org/1432/greenshields-saving-the-planet-one-bus-at-a-time">Green Shields</a>, a project to render school buses more energy efficient, and created by another awesome kid, Jonny Cohen (now 16, but 12-years-old when he first had the idea).</p>
