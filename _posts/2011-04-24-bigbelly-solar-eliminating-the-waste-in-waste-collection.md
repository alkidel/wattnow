    by the TNO research institute.&nbsp;&nbsp; The technology is simple &#8211; a
    concrete module, covered with a 1cm layer of silicon solar cells, protected on
    top by a robust glass layer.&nbsp; The SolaRoad technology produces about 50kWh
    per m2 per year, enough to power street lights, traffic lights, and other small
    local needs (maybe even a BigBelly compactor ?). [...]"

<p><a href="http://bigbellysolar.com/">BigBelly Solar</a> promotes energy efficiency in waste collection with an "intelligent waste collection system" based on solar-powered compacting trash and recycling bins.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bigbellysolar.com/solutions/compactor/">BigBelly solar compactors</a> have sensors to detect when it will be desirable for "pick up" following multiple cycles of compaction at which point it sends a message through the CLEAN notification system, essentially calling to say "I'm full- time to empty me", greatly optimizing waste collection and associated costs.</p>
<p>In 2009-2010, Philadelphia installed 1,000 BigBelly solar compactors, and for Earth Month this year, Mural Arts Big Picture artists worked with students to decorate and convert 50 compactors into <a href="http://www.uwishunu.com/2011/04/mural-arts-unveils-50-litter-critters-artistically-decorated-solar-powered-compacting-trash-and-recycling-bins-designed-by-students/">"Litter Critters"</a> .</p>
