<p>Imagine you order a camera or a new book online, and several days later, you find out that your purchase also contributed to the investment of a solar project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dothebrightthing.nl/">Do The Bright Thing</a>, based in the Netherlands, has developed a creative financing model for solar projects through online shopping. &nbsp;With Do The Bright Thing's shopping platform, shoppers can chose from over 1 million products, and for every purchase made through the site, 10% of the purchase value is invested in solar energy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dothebrightthing.nl/"><img title="dothebrightthing - logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/dothebrightthing-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="155" height="310" /></a></p>
<p>How does it work? &nbsp;For the shopper, there's really no difference or premium in his or her shopping experience. &nbsp;Do The Bright Thing is free to join, and the price of the products is the same as if the shopper bought it elsewhere. &nbsp;Do The Bright Thing has partnered with 300 shopping sites and offers over 1 million products.</p>
<p>Do The Bright Thing partners with manufacturers and distributors to sell the products on their website, and a percentage of the sale goes to Do The Bright Thing to invest in solar.</p>
<p>For each product offered, Do The Bright Thing calculates the product's <a href="http://www.dothebrightthing.nl/You-buy-stuff">"embedded energy"</a>, the energy needed to manufacture the product, and will invest in enough solar power to offset that embedded energy - thus, the customer can finish shopping with a slightly clearer conscious regarding the environmental impact of his or her purchases.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="http://www.dothebrightthing.nl/We-buy-solar">within 60 days of a shopper's purchase</a>, the solar energy associated with the purchase will be installed - and verified by an independent advisory board. &nbsp;The shopper can then follow the progress and details of the solar power installed from his or her purchase.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/dothebrightthing-feature.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1806" title="dothebrightthing- feature" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/02/dothebrightthing-feature.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="638" height="239" /></a></p>
<p>Do The Bright Thing's shopping platform is currently only operating in the Netherlands but the group plans to expand in the upcoming months. &nbsp;Do The Bright Thing has also partnered with <a href="http://www.fairclimatefund.nl/en/">Fair Climate Fund</a>&nbsp;to adhere to a commitment of installing 5% of solar panels in developing countries.</p>
<p>From my perspective, there are two interesting concepts being addressed through Do The Bright Thing's model: a) raising investment capital in a clever way, and b) empowering individuals with solar power commitment.</p>
<p>One big issue with solar power is the financial investment profile. &nbsp;Even though solar will pay back eventually, that initial investment will often be a huge turnoff - for individuals and investors. &nbsp;But if the cash is available, solar IS a good investment. &nbsp;And Do The Bright Thing has figured out a creative way to raise that initial cash necessary.</p>
<p>And second, by coupling online shopping (in a way that does not detract from the shopper's experience) with solar investment, the individual shopper is inadvertently empowered - empowered to contribute and be part of an energy project. &nbsp;And the shopper can then follow the progress of the solar project - just like <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">Kiva investors</a> can follow the progress of their investments in micro-entrepreneurs. &nbsp;This connection educates and enlightens the shopper, and most of all, helps the shopper recognize that he or she as an individual, can make a difference.</p>
