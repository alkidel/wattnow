<p><a href="http://tree-nation.com/">Tree Nation</a>, with a small dynamic team based in Barcelona, Spain, is building an online community dedicated to fighting climate change by simply... planting trees!</p>
<p>Partnering with UNEP (UN Environment Programme) and its Plant for the Planet campaign since 2006, Tree Nation's tree-investing community is growing rapidly with&nbsp;over 90,000 people and 120 European and international companies involved.</p>
<p>And as of today, <strong>388,864 trees have been planted</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/home"><img title="tree-nation logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/tree-nation-logo.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="415" height="132" /></a></p>
<p>Tree Nation's model is a bit like Kiva's -- you choose the project you want to invest in and you can then follow the progress of your project. &nbsp;You can invest as little as 5,5&euro; (or even <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/what-is-tree-nation">participate for free</a>). &nbsp;But instead of investing in social entrepreneurs, you're investing in trees. &nbsp;And instead of getting repaid in money, you get rewarded by knowing that you are contributing to combatting desertification, deforestation, and climate change.</p>
<p>Tree Nation has currently four major projects in <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/projects/1">Niger</a>, <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/projects/2">Nicaragua</a>, <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/projects/3">Colombia</a>, and <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/projects/4">Madagascar</a>.</p>
<p>Let's say you decide to invest in some trees. &nbsp;You choose the <strong><a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/projects/1">Niger Heart</a></strong> project, Tree Nation's ambition project of planting 8 million trees in the shape of a giant heart by 2015 (currently, just over 300,000 trees have been planted for this project).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/projects/1"><img class="size-full wp-image-1926" title="tree-nation niger heart" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/tree-nation-niger-heart.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="260" height="156" /></a></p>
<p>You decide to plant 2&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/plant">Acacia senegal</a>&nbsp;trees (7&euro; / tree). &nbsp;The Acacia senegal has a long root system, which restores and enhances the fertility of the soil. &nbsp;Moreover, it serves as food for livestock and produces resin and gum. &nbsp;The Acacia senegal has a life expectancy of 30 years and absorbs 180 kg of CO2 over it's lifetime (15 kg/year for 12 years. &nbsp;Trees absorb most CO2 during their growth period).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/plant"><img class="size-full wp-image-1927" title="tree-nation Acacia Senegal" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/tree-nation-Acacia-Senegal.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>You can then follow the growth of your trees and the progress of the Niger Heart program. &nbsp;Easy, right?</p>
<p>If you are specifically concerned about offsetting <em>all</em> your CO2 emissions, you can become a <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/plant/serial">"serial planter"</a>, investing on a monthly basis. &nbsp;To completely offset your footprint, Tree Nation estimates you will need to plant 24 trees / year which will cost 14&euro; / month.</p>
<p>Tree Nation bases its offset calculations on the the official European average for CO2 emissions: 9 tons of CO2 / person / year (source: <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/public/documents/eurostats-co2-emissions-en.pdf">eurostat</a>).</p>
<p>9 tons of CO2 emitted is equivalent to 24 trees absorbing approximately 20 kgCO2 for a period of 20 years => 24*20*20.</p>

<p>Tree Nation has also engaged companies such as Google, The Economist, and Procter &amp; Gamble to become tree planters through its corporate program. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/partners">The Economist for instance</a>,&nbsp;plants one tree for every new susbcriber in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. &nbsp;New readers are then invited to follow the progress of their trees and get actively involved.</p>
<p>Overall, Tree Nation is a clever and innovative social network that allows individuals and companies to easily get involved in fighting climate change -- even while sitting on your couch at home. &nbsp;And for those who are motivated, you can <a href="http://www.tree-nation.com/faqs/general#q3">visit the tree sites</a> during plantation period and get your "hands dirty".</p>
<p>Plant a tree in a couple clicks. &nbsp;Let's do it!</p>
