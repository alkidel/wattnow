  content: Outstanding! What a marvelous idea. It is interesting that gasoline was
    originally the waste product from the production of kerosene and refiners were
    looking for some other use for it. Wouldn't it be exceptional to find other productive
    uses for various waste products such a Vitali is doing? Remember the recycled
    paper clothes from the late sixties and early seventies.

<p>Italian artist / ecologist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.artnest.it/">Ivano Vitali</a> combines newspaper recycling and knitting to produce extraordinarily-woven clothing and objects.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/ivano-vitali-creates-zero-waste-garments-from-recycled-newspaper-yarn/ivano-vitali-1/?extend=1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1875" title="vitali - studio" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/03/vitali-studio.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="510" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>Vitali upcycles old newspaper by cutting the newspaper into strips, twisting and overlapping the strips into taut long string pieces which he then rolls into a "newspaper yarn ball" - without the use of dyes nor glue.</p>
<p>With large custom-made knitting needles (<a href="http://www.ecouterre.com/ivano-vitali-creates-zero-waste-garments-from-recycled-newspaper-yarn/ivano-vitali-2/?extend=1">up to 8 feet long!</a>), Vitali then weaves the paper yarn into a variety of objects - from dresses to tapestries to chair seats.</p>

<p>Vitali has been using waste paper as a medium for his art since 1995, and <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-fashion/artist-knits-recycled-newspapers-beautiful-clothing-photos.html">he describes the purpose of his work</a> : "My primary aim remains the communication of the ecological message to all the peoples of the earth, because I believe that well being and happiness are dependent upon a respect for the environment, and I am therefore convinced that every person, without exception, must stand for the defense of planet earth against any form of pollution".</p>
