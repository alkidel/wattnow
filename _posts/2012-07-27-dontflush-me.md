<p><a href="http://dontflush.me/category/blog"><strong>DontFlushMe</strong></a> is a NYC-based crowdsourcing project to engage residents in reducing the amount of sewage pollution in the New York Harbor through network-connected Arduino-programmed sensors.</p>
<p><a href="http://dontflush.me/"><img title="dontflushme_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/07/dontflushme_logo-1024x149.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="670" height="97" /></a></p>
<p>Did you know that approximately <a href="http://www.riverkeeper.org/campaigns/stop-polluters/sewage-contamination/cso/">27 billion gallons of raw sewage</a> (re. the goods you flush down the toilet) gets dumped into the New York Harbor every year?</p>
<p>New York City's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dcwater.com/wastewater_collection/css/default.cfm">combined sewer system</a>&nbsp;collects wastewater <strong>and</strong> storm water in the same piping system (as opposed to a "separate" system which will have individual piping for each water streams).</p>
<p>When it rains in New York, the sewer system (filled with a mix of rainwater and toilet&nbsp;excrement) will often reach its capacity. &nbsp;In order to relieve congestion, the sewer system is lined with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/48595.html">460 Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO)</a>&nbsp;regulators, which discharge excess wastewater directly into the New York Harbor.</p>

<p>DontFlushMe plans to build a network of Arduino-based sensors, that will measure the water level at the CSO regulators and submit data to a centralized database.</p>
<p>The collected data will be available over a large alert network, and in case of emergency (and in order to prevent overflow), members of the DontFlushMe community will receive a text message to act appropriately-- in other words, DON'T FLUSH!</p>

<p>Prototype sensors were installed in June and anyone can now sign up to <a href="http://dontflush.me/category/blog">receive text message updates</a>.</p>
<p>DontFlushMe founder Leif Percifield also plans to design an internet-connected lightbulb, <a href="https://ioby.org/project/dontflushme">the "bulbuino"</a>, that will also signal the status of CSO data.</p>
<p>What I like most about DontFlushMe is that solicits community-invested participation to meet a local energy challenge. &nbsp;We as individuals can contribute to an effort that will have an impact. &nbsp;Energy 2.0.</p>
<p>Morever, Leif Percifield is no water expert -- but a technologist and designer with just a really cool idea.</p>
