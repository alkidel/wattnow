<p><a href="http://opower.com/">Opower</a>&nbsp;is an energy efficiency software company that partners with utilities (57 to date) to provide a customer engagement platform for household customers to track, understand, and optimize their energy use.</p>
<p><a href="http://opower.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-773 alignnone" title="Screen Shot 2011-11-09 at 5.22.16 PM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-09-at-5.22.16-PM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="232" height="81" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Back in 2006, Opower founders Alex Laskey and Dan Yates knew they wanted to start a project in energy and the environment - but moreover, they wanted to do something that made a real IMPACT.</p>
<p>The two guys realized that contrary to most energy and climate issues, energy efficiency is something that everyone more or less agrees on - democrats, republicans, rich, poor, men, women, even utilities. &nbsp;<strong>We can all agree that using less energy is a good thing.</strong></p>
<p>They also noticed that a lot of engineers and companies were focusing on innovating on the supply side (solar, wind, storage, etc) rather than the demand side (how we USE energy).</p>
<p>And that the industry was totally underestimating the impact we could make improving the demand side.</p>
<p>Thus, Opower was born. &nbsp;And in less than 5 years, Opower has grown from 2 to 250 employees and has<strong> saved 500 million kWh, <a href="http://opower.com/impact">as much energy as that produced by more than 50% of the US solar industry</a>.</strong></p>
<p>What makes Opower different from the other smart grid players?</p>
<p>Well to start, Opower calls its technology "behavior-based energy efficiency". &nbsp;They realize that people want to save more energy at home, but that there is a <strong>big gap between intention and action</strong>. &nbsp;Thus, Opower uses <strong><a href="http://opower.com/uploads/library/file/15/xrds_opower.pdf">behavioral science</a></strong> to design its software to actually get the customers to change the way they use energy. &nbsp;For instance, the Neighbor Comparison:</p>
<p>Each household receives a report, showing how their recent energy use compares to that of average neighbors, as well as to their most efficient neighbors. &nbsp;As Opower puts it, "even those who are not motivated by money or the environment can be motivated by competition". &nbsp;The idea of comparing ourselves with our neighbors reminds me of this awesome 1BOG infographic titled <a href="http://1bog.org/blog/infographic-the-science-of-peer-pressure/">The Science of Peer Pressure</a>.</p>

<p>
<p>Beyond the science, Opower customizes the software for the user based on the customer's personal information - housing type, demographic, geography - to provide and present information and improvements that actually engage and make sense for the users.</p>
<p>And finally, Opower realized that the way to really make things happen quickly -- was to <a href="http://opower.com/utilities">partner with the utilities</a>. &nbsp;Other companies shied away from approaching the giants, but instead of fight or shy away from them, Opower partnered with them. &nbsp;And now <strong>over 10 million households are using Opower software</strong>. &nbsp;Talk about impact.</p>
<p>In addition to the utilities, Opower recently made another strategic partnership in order to reach out to millions in the fastest and most effective way in our social media driven culture: <a href="http://opower.com/company/news-press/press_releases/40">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>By leveraging the Facebook platform, Opower, Facebook, and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) will create a <a href="http://social.opower.com/?source=opowerhome">new social energy application,</a> that will enable consumers to benchmark their home's energy usage against a national average, compare their energy use with friends, enter energy-saving competitions, and share tips on how to become more energy efficient.</p>
<p>A bit like Farmville, but ya know, with real-life applications that could actually engage (real) communities and save (real) households a lot of money. &nbsp;The app will be running in early 2012, but you can <a href="https://social.opower.com/">sign up now</a> to be first in line.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
