<p style="text-align: justify;">From the same guys that developed the <a title="Hummm &hellip;" href="http://alki.delichatsios.com/?p=4">Humdinger technology</a> comes... <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmcrae/b-squares-modular-solar-powered-electrics">B-Squares</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is ... awesome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/05/quatro_arduino.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-medium wp-image-182 alignnone" title="quatro_arduino" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/05/quatro_arduino-300x228.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="228" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How do I explain?&nbsp; It's a system based on modules or "squares" - each standard in shape and size.&nbsp; Each module serves a certain function - any function really (so far they've developed the battery square, the LED square, the iPhone square, and more ...) -- and YOU can even program what you want it to do - especially with the arduino module.&nbsp; The squares have magnetic edges, allowing them to "snap into" one another.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Above all, the idea is that squares are powered with the "fundamental square" which is the <strong>solar square</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Example - you're at a picnic and a) your iPhone is dead, and/or b) you want to play music.&nbsp; Just hook up the <strong>Solar square</strong> to the <strong>iPhone square</strong> which serves as a charger, a dock, and possible a connector to <strong>Speaker squares.</strong> From ANYWHERE (as long as there's sun.&nbsp; But otherwise, just bring along the <strong>Battery square</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/05/iPodSquare1_small.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class="size-medium wp-image-196 alignnone" title="iPodSquare1_small" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/05/iPodSquare1_small-300x167.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It's portable.&nbsp; It's functional.&nbsp; And most of all, B-Squares brings renewable energy to the individual.&nbsp; It's shifting the paradigm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you still don't totally get it, here's a video that explains it all:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rLasAIhNM58" frameborder="0" width="560" height="349"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is currently on Kickstarter, so if you want to be more involved, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmcrae/b-squares-modular-solar-powered-electrics">invest in B-Squares</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'm extremely excited about my B-Ginner's Kit (Solar Square, Battery Square, and LED Square).....</p>
