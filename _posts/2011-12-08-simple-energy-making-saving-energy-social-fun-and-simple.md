<p>Based in Boulder, CO, <a href="http://www.simpleenergy.com/">Simple Energy</a>&nbsp;is developing an online platform that engages consumers to understand their energy usage and compete with their Facebook friends in order to save energy (and money) in a fun and simple way.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simpleenergy.com/splash/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1038" title="simpleenergy logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/simpleenergy-logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="348" height="109" /></a></p>
<p>The Simple Energy solution meets a four-fold objective, as described on their <a href="http://www.simpleenergy.com/about-us">website</a>:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Engagement -</strong>&nbsp;Building connections between utilities and their customers.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Efficiency -</strong>&nbsp;Changing behavior and boosting energy efficiency sign ups.</li>
<li><strong>Demand Response -</strong>&nbsp;Driving customer load shifting and increasing auto-DR participation.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Grid -</strong>&nbsp;Providing customers a fun way to understand and interact with the smart grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds a lot like <a title="Opower.  A new experience for utility customers." href="http://wattnow.org/772/opower-a-new-experience-for-utility-customers">Opower</a>. &nbsp;And similar to Opower, Simple Energy combines behavioral science and game mechanics to engage their customers. &nbsp;A little competition is a good thing, right?</p>
<p>An interesting tidbit about Simple Energy is that they have <a href="http://danariely.com/">Dan Ariely</a> has a scientific advisor. &nbsp;Dan Ariely was one of my favorite professors at MIT (in 15.301 Managerial Psychology) and an expert in behavioral economics. &nbsp;I imagine he provides valuable input on how to leverage the irrational behavior of humans in designing Simple Energy's platform.</p>
<p>Simple Energy recently <a href="http://www.bcbr.com/article.asp?id=59712">raised $900,000</a> in funding from angel investors, and if you want to live in Boulder, they are <a href="http://www.simpleenergy.com/jobs">currently hiring</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simpleenergy.com/splash/jobs"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1041" title="simpleenergymountains" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/simpleenergymountains.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="253" height="287" /></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a pretty awesome place to work&nbsp;- pets are encouraged, beer is provided, ski pass included, ... oh yea, and you'd get some equity stake in the company too.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/vallejolola">Lola</a> for the info!</p>
