<p>Have you ever wondered what to do with your old bras? You can't put them in the recycling bin and you don't really want to donate them either...</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that you CAN recycle your bras ! (unfortunately I discovered this after throwing 2 away...)</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.intimissimi.it/">Intimissimi</a>, an Italian-based lingerie store, they accept your old bras and recycle them into soundproofing material! And pay you 3&euro;/ bra!</p>
<p>Now that is sexy.</p>
