<p style="text-align: justify;">Cambridge, UK-based&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.eight19.com/">Eight19</a></strong>&nbsp;combines an innovative technology (organic solar PV) and an innovative business model (pay-as-you-go solar electricity system) to provide a low-cost solution for clean energy access to rural off-grid communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.eight19.com/"><img title="Eight19_logo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/06/Eight19_logo.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="183" height="49" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eight19 is a technology company. &nbsp;They develop and manufacture a <a href="http://www.eight19.com/technology/printed-plastic-solar-cells">novel printed plastic solar cell </a>technology based on organic semiconductor materials. &nbsp;As compared to the more conventional silicon-based solar cells, Eight19's solar cells are highly flexible, light weight, and most importantly, do not <a href="http://www.eight19.com/news-events/eight19-begins-organic-solar-trials-africa-0">drop in efficiency in higher temperatures</a>, making them extremely appropriate for off-grid applications in hot climate areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eight19's flexible organic solar modules are in development phase and large scale deployment is expected to begin in early 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.eight19.com/technology/printed-plastic-solar-cells"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2251" title="Eight19_thinfilm" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/06/Eight19_thinfilm.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="679" height="199" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should there be concern for this unique flexible plastic solar technology? &nbsp;<a title="Konarka.  The flexible shape of solar." href="http://wattnow.org/445/konarka-the-flexible-shape-of-solar">Konarka</a>, another producer of "solar plastic" technology&nbsp;<a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Romney-Backed-Konarka-and-its-Organic-Solar-Cells-File-For-Bankruptcy">filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy</a> just last week&nbsp;due to financial issues, technical problems (low efficiency and difficulty in achieving long lifetimes), and simply a precarious solar market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the moment, Eight19 seems to be withstanding these risks - and moreover,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eight19 is more than a technology company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to its organic solar modules, Eight19 has pivoted and developed the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.eight19.com/technology/indigo-delivers-power-grid-communities">IndiGo system</a>,</strong>&nbsp;an affordable pay-as-you-go solar lighting and battery charging system conceived for the 1.6 billion people in the world who do not have access to grid electricity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.eight19.com/technology/indigo-delivers-power-grid-communities"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2252" title="Eight19_IndiGo" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/06/Eight19_IndiGo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="680" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <strong><a href="http://www.eight19.com/sites/default/files/users/IndiGo_datasheet_final.pdf">IndiGo system</a></strong> includes a 2.5W solar panel (currently using silicon technology, but eventually to switch to Eight19's organic PV technology), a rechargeable battery, 2 LED light units (to light two rooms), and a USB port for phone charging.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <a href="http://wattnow.org/418/simpa-networks-radical-affordability">upfront costs of such a solar system</a> is a huge blocking point for users, especially in comparison to the incremental payment scheme that people are used to paying for their current lighting solution, kerosene.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eight19's pay-as-you-go system is meant to relieve the upfront cost issue, and compare and compete economically with kerosene.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eight19 uses the prevalence of mobile phones to create a secure and appropriate topup system:&nbsp;A user buys a scratchcard, which contains a code that the user will then SMS to IndiGo, who in return will send a text message with a topup code to the user that will unlock the IndiGo system. &nbsp;After a certain number of topup payments, the user will have completely paid off the cost of the IndiGo system and the user will become a full owner with the system being forever unlocked. &nbsp;And not only will the user have access to a cleaner and safer lighting source than kerosene, but the user will also be saving money after several months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eight19 has successfully deployed the IndiGo system in Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia, and most recently in May 2012, <a href="http://http://www.eight19.com/news-events/eight19-begins-organic-solar-trials-africa-0">Eight19 began organic solar trials in South Sudan</a>, combining their innovative organic flexible solar technology and their innovative pay-as-you-go business model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A company that can innovate and adapt. &nbsp;And hopefully, breakthrough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Why the name Eight19? &nbsp;Eight19 refers to the time it takes sunlight to reach the earth: 8 minutes and 19 seconds.</p>
