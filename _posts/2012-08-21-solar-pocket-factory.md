<p>From some of the same guys that brought <strong><a title="Hummm &hellip;" href="http://wattnow.org/4/hummm">Humdinger</a></strong>&nbsp;(micro-wind) and <strong><a title="B-Squares: Modular Solar Powered Electrics." href="http://wattnow.org/181/b-squares-modular-solar-powered-electrics">B-Squares</a>&nbsp;</strong>(portable solar), comes the <strong><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alex9000/the-solar-pocket-factory-an-invention-adventure?ref=category">Solar Pocket Factory</a>,&nbsp;</strong>a mini 'solar factory' for fabricating and assembling micro-solar products better and cheaper - and can be located anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alex9000/the-solar-pocket-factory-an-invention-adventure?ref=category"><img title="solarpocketfactory_3" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/08/solarpocketfactory_3-300x168.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>Micro-solar refers to solar cells for low-power applications like phone-charging and LED lighting - applications which are useful for many, but which are particularly critical in poor, rural, off-grid communities. &nbsp;One of the major issues of the solar manufacturing industry is that the center of gravity is in China - small solar lamps destined for rural Haiti have to be shipped from the other side of the world - which means that not only does the transport add significant cost and strife, but there is little-to-no opportunity for to create a local economy out of solar manufacturing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alex9000/the-solar-pocket-factory-an-invention-adventure?ref=category"><img title="solarpocketfactory_machine" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/08/solarpocketfactory_machine-300x225.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>The Solar Pocket Factory brings assembly and production local to where the micro-solar products will be sold and distributed. &nbsp;Moreover, the technology is designed to make production cheaper, and the products last longer.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/08/solarpocketfactory_compare.png' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2361" title="solarpocketfactory_compare" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/08/solarpocketfactory_compare.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="490" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the details about the Solar Pocket Factory are still a bit unclear - as in how much will a 'factory' cost? &nbsp;Who will finance, implement, &nbsp;and operate the factories? &nbsp;Are the basic materials easy to source? &nbsp;The factory can not manufacture the actual mini solar cells ('solettes') so where will those be coming from?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Solar Pocket Factory has the potential to shake up the micro-solar manufacturing industry - in a very positive way.</p>
<p>The Solar Pocket Factory is currently in prototype-phase and the bad boys behind this beauty, <a href="http://www.haddockinvention.com/">Shawn Frayne</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://manilamantis.com/">Alex Hornstein</a>&nbsp;have <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alex9000/the-solar-pocket-factory-an-invention-adventure?ref=category">launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $50,000</a>&nbsp;in order to bring the Solar Pocket Factory to scale production and impact the world of solar.</p>
<p>It's an unconventional Kickstarter project, because they're building a manufacturing process. &nbsp;If you invest, they can't really provide everyone with a solar factory - instead, they provide their donors with a "solar kit" to tinker with micro-solar:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alex9000/the-solar-pocket-factory-an-invention-adventure?ref=category"><img title="solarpocketfactory_kit" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/08/solarpocketfactory_kit-300x171.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="171" /></a></p>
<p>They also provide their investors to share with them their experience on this "invention adventure" to make the perfect solar panel. &nbsp;They're over half-way to their goal of $50,000.</p>
<p>Will you join me in helping the Solar Pocket Factory revolutionize the micro-solar industry?</p>
