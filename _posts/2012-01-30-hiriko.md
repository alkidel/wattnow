<p>The <a href="http://cp.media.mit.edu/research/54-citycar">Hiriko</a>, meaning "Urban Car" in Basque, is a folding electric vehicle with ultra-maneuverability, designed for crowded cities.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-57366140-54/electric-car-that-folds-itself-launches-in-spain/?tag=mncol;txt"><img class=" wp-image-1665 " title="hiriko - folding" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/hikiro-folding.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="468" height="292" /></a></p>
<p>Developed at <a href="http://cp.media.mit.edu/about">MIT Media Lab's Changing Places group</a>, the Hiriko is a project led by seven small Basque firms and was successfully unveiled at the European Commission last week.</p>
<p>The technical splendor behind the Hiriko are the "Wheel Robots". &nbsp;Basically, the maneuver components of the car - motor, suspension, steering, braking - are integrated into each wheel, instead of being centralized. &nbsp;These modular wheel systems allow several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compactness and foldability to reduce the overall footprint of the car when parked</li>
<li>Increase maneuverability including the capability for the car to spin around its own center</li>
<li>Decentralized system allowing for a simplified distributed manufacturing system</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hiriko is equipped with lithium-ion batteries with a driving range of 120km (75 miles) per charge. &nbsp;When folded, the Hiriko is about 60 inches, such that three Hiriko vehicles can fit in the same parking space as one normal car. &nbsp;The vehicle can carry two passengers, which enter the car through the front windshield which swings upward to open.</p>

<p>The Hiriko is&nbsp;envisaged as part of a car-sharing program like <a title="Autolib&rsquo;.  An urban revolution." href="http://wattnow.org/1059/autolib-an-urban-revolution">Autolib'</a>, but will also available for personal sale at about 12,500 euros.</p>
<p>Backed by <a href="http://www.denokinn.eu/">Denokinn</a>, a Basque investment group, trial production of 20 Hiriko cars and a pilot of a car-sharing program will begin in 2013 in the Basque Region. &nbsp;And eventually they hope to expand to cities around the world, with discussions already in progress with Berlin, Barcelona, San Francisco, and Hong Kong.</p>
