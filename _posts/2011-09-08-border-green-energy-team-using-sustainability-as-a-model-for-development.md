<p>The <a href="http://www.bget.org/">Border Green Energy Team </a>(BGET) was founded in 2005 and brings renewable energy and sustainable technologies to refugee, minority, and rural communities along the<strong> Thailand-Burma border</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bget.org/"><img title="Screen shot 2011-09-08 at 3.41.40 PM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-08-at-3.41.40-PM1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="441" height="87" /></a></p>
<p>BGET has three focus areas:</p>
<ul >
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Renewable energy and appropriate technology</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical education and capacity building</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sustainability in rural development</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BGET teams work on energy (solar, micro-hydro, and bio-gas) and water (pumps and purification systems) projects, and educate and train refugees with the systems to create a local, sustainable, and empowered community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bget.org/"><img class="size-full wp-image-371 alignnone" title="Screen shot 2011-09-08 at 3.43.58 PM" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/Screen-shot-2011-09-08-at-3.43.58-PM.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="910" height="199" /></a></p>
<p>BGET has quite a <a href="http://www.bget.org/about-the-team/background/">successful record after only six years</a>, including constructing and operating <strong>7 micro-hydro systems</strong> and <strong>training over 300 Karen village leaders</strong> on Solar Home Systems (SHS) repair and maintenance.</p>
<p>You can get involved by <a href="http://www.bget.org/how-to-help/volunteering/">donating or volunteering</a>!</p>
<p>Six months in Thailand, working on solar panels and teaching excited students - sounds awesome to me.</p>
