<p><a href="http://www.konarka.com/index.php">Konarka</a> develops <a href="http://www.konarka.com/index.php/power-plastic/about-power-plastic/">"Power Plastic"</a>, a thin and flexible organic photovoltaic technology that can be easily integrated into building materials like curtain walls and windows (which is known as BIPV - building integrated photovoltaics), remote flexible structures like <a href="http://www.konarka.com/media/pdf/konarka_casestudy_sanfrancisco.pdf">bus stops in San Francisco</a>, or even portable products like tents or backpacks!</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/busstop1.jpg' | relative_url }}"><img class=" wp-image-448 alignnone" title="busstop" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/busstop1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="620" height="202" /></a></p>
<p>Konarka's Power Plastic is based on a photo-reactive polymer material, and though it has a lower efficiency than conventional crystalline silicon solar panels, its low-cost for materials, <a href="http://www.konarka.com/index.php/technology/roll-to-roll-manufacturing-process/">manufacturing</a>, and maintenance, coupled with on-going research to improve the efficiency allow huge potential for Power Plastics to lead the solar industry.</p>
<p>On top of all that, Power Plastic is the only thin-film PV technology that uses <a href="http://www.konarka.com/index.php/technology/our-technology/">all recyclable materials</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://konarka.com/"><img class="size-full wp-image-449 alignnone" title="solar backpacks" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/solar-backpacks.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="693" height="161" /></a></p>
<p>Either Konarka has an extremely convincing marketing team - or Solar Plastic really does have huge potential (I think it's the latter). &nbsp;Visit Konarka's website and read about the progress of the technology and the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.konarka.com/index.php/power-plastic/power-plastic-products/">interesting projects </a>they're working on.</p>
<p>Konarka is based in Lowell, MA with offices in Germany and Japan.</p>
