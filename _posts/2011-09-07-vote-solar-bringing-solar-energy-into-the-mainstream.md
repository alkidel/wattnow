<p><a href="http://votesolar.org/">Vote Solar</a> is a solar advocacy group based in San Francisco that is bolstering and facilitating solar energy projects from a process and policy perspective - on a federal, state, local (ie. cities), AND community level.</p>
<p><a href="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/votesolar.gif' | relative_url }}"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-359" title="votesolar" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/09/votesolar.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="347" height="131" /></a></p>

<p>You can get involved by joining the <a href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1179/t/10049/signUp.jsp?key=987">email sign-up</a>&nbsp;and they will send (just enough, not too much) info about big news, local events, or opportunities to participate and make a difference on key solar issues.</p>
<p>Moreover, Vote Solar has an excellent set of <a href="http://votesolar.org/resources/">solar resources</a>, and they are launching a free weekly webinar series called <strong><a href="http://votesolar.org/resources/get-some-sun-solar-webinars/">Get Some Sun</a>. &nbsp;</strong>The next webinar is on Wednesday, September 21st:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>"Midterm PV Progress Report"</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>An assessment on the current state of the industry, updates on international PV markets, and prognostications on what it all means for 2012 -- with Paula Mints of Navigant Consulting.</em></p>
<p>I signed up already. &nbsp;<a href="https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/859364576">And you should too!</a></p>
