  content: I am a strategic advisor to Methane Harvest. Thanks for the shout out.
    One correction (typo)--your article states "Methane Harvest&rsquo;s CHP system
    can provide 100% of the plant&rsquo;s electricity needs and >30% of the electricity
    needs." The first "electricity" in the quote should read "heat", i.e. we provide
    100% of the plant's heat needs and 30%+ of the electricity needs. Best, Todd Thorner

<p><a href="http://www.methaneharvest.com/chp/index.php">Methane Harvest</a>, based in Cambridge, MA, delivers a genius solution for waste water treatment plants which converts the plant's waste into electricity and heating. &nbsp;Moreover, MH's innovative <a href="http://www.methaneharvest.com/solution/index.php">build-own-operate model</a>&nbsp;provides a risk-free, cheap, local, and clean electricity solution for the plant and the plant's community.</p>

<p>We all know that Watt Now loves anaerobic digesters (processing organic waste to produce methane as fuel), as we've seen with <a title="Purpose Energy, Inc." href="http://wattnow.org/27/purpose-energy-inc">Purpose</a>, <a title="The Power of Dog Poop" href="http://wattnow.org/79/the-power-of-dog-poop">Park Spark</a>, <a title="Sanergy. Building Sustainable Sanitation in Urban Slums." href="http://wattnow.org/254/sanergy-building-sustainable-sanitation-in-urban-slums">Sanergy</a>, and <a title="Harvest Power.  The new generation in organics management." href="http://wattnow.org/473/harvest-power-the-new-generation-in-organics-management">Harvest</a>.</p>
<p>Methane Harvest is another great project integrating the bio-digester concept. &nbsp;But they doesn't actually build the bio-digesters -</p>
<p>Rather, Methane Harvest leverages the fact that bio-digesters already exist at water treatment plants, and provides on-site&nbsp;<a href="http://www.methaneharvest.com/solution/index.php">Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems</a>&nbsp;that are fueled by the plant's digester methane.</p>

<p>Methane Harvest's CHP system can provide 100% of the plant's heat needs and >30% of the electricity needs.</p>
<p>And what's most exciting about Methane Harvest's solution -- is the business model. &nbsp;Methane Harvest assumes all costs associated with the CHP and in return, contracts with the plant's municipality to purchase electricity generated at below-market rates under a 20-year agreement.</p>
<p>"We build it. &nbsp;We own it. &nbsp;We operate it. &nbsp;You save."</p>
<p>Methane Harvest's model is a creatively-designed&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Purchase_Agreement">Power Purchase Agreement</a>, a model we're starting to see more and more with solar projects, like <a title="SolSolution.  Clean energy for education." href="http://wattnow.org/505/solsolution-clean-energy-for-education">SolSolution</a>&nbsp;does for solar panels on schools.</p>
<p>Specific application. &nbsp;Proven technology. &nbsp;Creative business model. &nbsp;And local. &nbsp;Awesome.</p>
