<p><a href="http://www.makanipower.com/">Makani Power</a>, located in Alameda, CA, consists of a group of kite surfing-engineers designing airborne wind turbines (AWT) with innovative wing mounted generators to produce efficient and consistent wind-generated electricity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.makanipower.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1149" title="makaniLogoHCW" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/makaniLogoHCW.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="200" height="60" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Makani's AWT, flying at altitudes of 300-600 meters, is a rigid wing with small mounted rotors that drive high-speed generators. &nbsp;The electricity is transmitted to the ground by conductors in the tether.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.makanipower.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1150" title="makani turbine" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/makani-turbine.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="384" height="370" /></a></p>


<p>Why so high? &nbsp;Traditional <a href="http://www.makanipower.com/2010/06/horizontal-axis-wind-turbine/">horizontal axis wind turbines</a>&nbsp;(HAWT) stand on towers of about 100 meters. &nbsp;By flying at altitudes 3-6x higher, Makani's AWT can benefit from stronger and more consistent winds. &nbsp;Therefore, Makani's AWT has a higher net capacity factor (NCF) than traditional wind turbines. &nbsp;In fact, Makani's AWT's <a href="http://www.makanipower.com/faq/faq/#4">NCF is greater than 30%</a> (which is considered a minimum capacity factor for localizing a grid-scale wind farm) over almost the entire US.</p>
<p>Traditional wind turbines have an NCF greater than 30% only over 15% of the US. &nbsp;This means we can localize Makani systems even in "less-windy" locations where normal horizontal axis wind turbines would not operate efficiently.</p>
<p>In addition to being more efficient than traditional wind turbines, the Makani system weighs 1/10 of the mass and is half the cost of an equivalent HAWT. &nbsp;Wow!</p>
<p>Makani Power, founded in 2006, is funded by <a href="http://arpa-e.energy.gov/">ARPA-E</a> as well as venture capitalists including&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/green/collaborations/investments.html">Google</a>, and recently won <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/solar-wind/a-turbine-to-tap-the-high-winds-at-1300-feet">Popular Mechanic's 2011 Breakthrough Innovator Award in the Energy Category</a>.</p>
<p>Makani is currently running test flights and plans to have a 1MW prototype ready in 2013 and a commercialized product in 2015.</p>
