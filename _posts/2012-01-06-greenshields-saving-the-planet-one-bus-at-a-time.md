<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://web.me.com/jonnymonster/GreenShields/Welcome.html">GreenShields</a>, based just outside of Chicago in Highland Park, IL, is a project to retrofit traditional school buses with a Plexiglas shield to reduce <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)">drag</a> and therefore <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2011/12/19/30-under-30-energy/">reduce fuel consumption by up to 28%</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.me.com/jonnymonster/GreenShields/Designing.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1433 " title="greenshield - bus" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/greenshield-bus-300x225.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> Plexiglas shield to improve the aerodynamics of a school bus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;GreenShields is run by a <a href="http://web.me.com/jonnymonster/GreenShields/Team.html">bunch of teenagers</a>, led by Jonny Cohen, 16, the genius behind the project - the idea for which he had <a href="http://web.me.com/jonnymonster/GreenShields/About_Us.html">when he was 12</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.me.com/jonnymonster/GreenShields/Team.html"><img class="size-full wp-image-1434 " title="greenshields - jonnny" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/greenshields-jonnny.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a> Jonny Cohen, inventor of GreenShields<span style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Are you feeling depressed that a 12-year-old had more creative ingenuity than you do?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I admit I felt that way at first. &nbsp;But now, I'm just really inspired. &nbsp;Jonny had a patent application ready, but decided to withdraw it, because <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2011/12/19/30-under-30-energy/">he says</a> "I'm not necessarily looking to make money off this. &nbsp;I want to make as big of a difference as possible".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And what I find exciting about this project is that a small, simple adjustment to an existing system can make a huge impact. &nbsp;When you consider that a school bus has a fuel efficiency of about 8 mpg, and that adding a simple piece of plastic could improve that mileage by 2 -3 mpg, that's huge! &nbsp;Especially when we're talking about hundreds of thousands of school buses in the US alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jonny Cohen and his team won a $25,000 grant from Pepsi and Jonny was recently highlighted on <a href="http://www.forbes.com/special-report/2011/30-under30-12/30-under-30-12_energy.html">Forbes' 30 under 30: Energy</a> list.</p>
