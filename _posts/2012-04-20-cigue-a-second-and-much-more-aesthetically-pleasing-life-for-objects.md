<p><strong><a href="http://www.cigue.net/">Cigu&euml;</a>, </strong>based in Montreuil - the burgeoning creative suburb of Paris, is&nbsp;a unique architecture collective that explores design through a DIY hands-on process. &nbsp;Instead of relying primarily on sketches, [the six architects that make up Cigu&euml;] focus on handling and understanding materials, objects, and surroundings to inspire their creations.</p>

<p>Though the collective is not regimented to "eco-conception", the architects privilege the use of&nbsp;natural and local resources and&nbsp;objects that <a href="http://deborahantoinat.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/portrait-du-collectif-cigue/">"already have a story"</a>. &nbsp;The result of this leitmotif is an aesthetic that is earthy, rustic, peaceful - and sustainable.</p>

<p>Though Cigu&euml;'s collection is not directly or entirely focused on recycling, I am inspired and impressed by the pieces that <em>do</em> reuse waste objects in a way that is creative, unassuming, and natural.</p>
<p>Cigu&euml; furniture can be found at <a href="http://www.mylittle.fr/mylittleparis/en/concept-store-paris.html">Merci</a>, a concept store (a sort of one-stop aesthetic wonderland!) in Paris. &nbsp;I'm actually in the process of decorating my new apartment, but while I don't think I can afford&nbsp;Cigu&euml; furniture quite yet,&nbsp;I hope to be inspired by the Cigu&euml; works&nbsp;to just -- do it myself.</p>
