<p><a href="http://www.soccket.com/">sOccket</a>, a project developed by four female students as a class assignment at Harvard, is a unique, eco-friendly <strong>soccer ball</strong> that generates and stores electricity to power small electronic devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.soccket.com/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1120" title="soccket" src="{{ 'assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2011/12/soccket.png' | relative_url }}" alt="" width="253" height="81" /></a></p>

<p>30 minutes of playing soccer can power an LED light for three hours. &nbsp;Or a phone charger. &nbsp;Wattnow has document similar technologies developed for emerging countries such as the <a title="NOKERO and En&egrave;ji Pw&ograve;p. Bringing solar-powered light to rural Haiti." href="http://wattnow.org/661/nokero-and-eneji-pwop-bringing-solar-light-to-rural-haiti">NOKERO</a> and <a title="LuminAID.  An inflatable solar light." href="http://wattnow.org/737/luminaid-an-inflatable-solar-light">luminAID</a> lightbulbs, as efficient, cost-effective, and safer alternatives to kerosene lamps.</p>

<p>sOccket is different from these other technologies since the power generated is not from solar energy, but from <a href="http://www.soccket.com/how-it-works/">kinetic energy</a>.</p>
<p>The sOccket ball generates electricity through a gyroscopic design. &nbsp;This energy is then stored in a capacitor or a battery, which can then be used at a later time to power electric devices like LED lamps.</p>
<p>Though the sOccket is not a regulation ball, the extra functionality of the sOccket <a href="http://www.soccket.com/how-it-works/">adds only 140grams</a> as compared to a normal soccer ball. &nbsp;Moreover, the sOccket is eco-friendly, made with 95% recycled materials, and highly durable, lasting 3+ years.</p>
<p>sOcckets are currently distributed through sponsors - both corporate and philanthropic. &nbsp;As for individuals, you can <a href="http://www.soccket.com/donate/">"Give-one"</a> through their online store and sOccket will soon be offering a <a href="http://www.soccket.com/how-it-works/">"Buy One, Give One"</a> option so you too can benefit from this awesome generator-soccer ball while also providing a resource-poor family with access to soccer-generated clean energy.</p>

<p>sOccket is funded primarily through private investors via its parent company, <a href="http://www.unchartedplay.com/">Uncharted Play</a>. &nbsp;In the past, the project has also received grants from the Clinton Global Initiative University and the Walmart Foundation, and most recently, sOccket was named as one of <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1678976/mckinsey-announces-social-innovation-contest-winners">McKinsey's Social Innovation Contest winners</a>.</p>
<p>As Bill Clinton explains sOccket,</p>
<p>"An idea for a clean energy - that I think it's fair to say, hardly anybody else on the planet had ever thought of. &nbsp;<strong>It's quite extraordinary really. &nbsp;Kick a ball, turn on a light</strong>".</p>
