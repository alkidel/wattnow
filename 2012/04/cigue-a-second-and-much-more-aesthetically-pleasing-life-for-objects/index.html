<meta name="description" content="Cigu&euml;, based in Montreuil - the burgeoning creative suburb of Paris, is&nbsp;a unique architecture collective that explores design through a DIY hands-on process. &nbsp;Instead of relying primarily on sketches, [the six architects that make up Cigu&euml;] focus on handling and understanding materials, objects, and surroundings to inspire their creations. Though the collective is not regimented to &quot;eco-conception&quot;, the architects privilege the use of&nbsp;natural and local resources and&nbsp;objects that &quot;already have a story&quot;. &nbsp;The result of this leitmotif is an aesthetic that is earthy, rustic, peaceful - and sustainable. &nbsp; &nbsp; Though Cigu&euml;&#39;s collection is not directly or entirely focused on recycling, I am inspired and impressed by the pieces that do reuse waste objects in a way that is creative, unassuming, and natural. Cigu&euml; furniture can be found at Merci, a concept store (a sort of one-stop aesthetic wonderland!) in Paris. &nbsp;I&#39;m actually in the process of decorating my new apartment, but while I don&#39;t think I can afford&nbsp;Cigu&euml; furniture quite yet,&nbsp;I hope to be inspired by the Cigu&euml; works&nbsp;to just -- do it myself." />
