<meta name="description" content="Auckland, New Zealand-based&nbsp;LanzaTech&nbsp;converts waste carbon monoxide (from steel mills, oil refineries, chemical plants, etc) into ethanol and high-value chemicals using proprietary gas fermentation microbes. &nbsp;A two-fold miracle worker - 1. creating value out of waste, and 2. reducing co2 emissions. The LanzaTech process centers around its patented, wholly-owned microbe, categorized as a WHO-risk 1 organism (same as baker&#39;s yeast). &nbsp;Through a fermentation process, the microbe acts as a biocatalyst to break down industrial waste gases into ethanol and eventually other fuels and chemicals, including diesel, jet fuel, and plastics. &nbsp;Check out this video&nbsp;for a more-detailed explanation of the LanzaTech process. &nbsp; I&#39;ll admit - a small part of LanzaTech&#39;s attraction is its Kiwi roots (though they have expanded their offices to China and the US) and a strong female leader at its head, Jennifer Holmgren. Beyond these rarities, LanzaTech, along with other startups like Joule Unlimited and Novomer, is making headlines by moving quickly and strategically towards a clean, economic, and industrial-scale waste-to-energy solution. &nbsp;Lanzatech launched a pilot plant in 2008 at the BlueScope Steel Mill in New Zealand, successfully demonstrating the LanzaTech process and plans a full-scale commercial facility in 2012, and the world&#39;s first steel waste gas to ethanol plant in 2013. LanzaTech, backed by Khosla Ventures, has also secured strategic industrial partnerships to guarantee a robust full-scale expansion. &nbsp;For example, they&#39;ve partnered with Chinese steel manufacturer giants, like China&#39;s #1 BaoSteel Group Corp, to build plants at steel mills, as well as the US Department of Energy on making jet fuel. &nbsp;Ya know, just a couple &quot;small&quot; partnerships to name a few. Clearly, not only does LanzaTech possess a brilliant technology, but they know how to leverage the technology in today&#39;s international market. LanzaTech was founded in 2005&nbsp;with a goal&nbsp;&quot;to develop and commercialize proprietary technologies for the production of low-carbon fuels that do not compromise food or land resources&quot;. &nbsp;Today, that goal is about to be realized." />
