<meta name="description" content="Solaire 2G, based in Marseille, France, is developing &nbsp;a novel and patented dual-purpose solar panel that combines PV and heat exchanger technology to produce both electricity and hot water. Standard PV panels are about 15% efficient, and effectively the remaining 85% is lost -- as heat. &nbsp;Solaire 2G&#39;s design includes a heat exchanger that extracts this &quot;waste heat&quot; to be used for the building&#39;s water-heating. &nbsp;Solaire 2G&#39;s &quot;DualSun&quot; panels can therefore provide 100% of a building&#39;s electricity needs and up to 65% of hot water needs. The solar electrical/thermal cogeneration concept is not particularly new, as we&#39;ve seen with others like EchoFirst. &nbsp;But Solaire 2G&#39;s innovative design and two solid patents optimize size, weight, and fabrication to provide a compact, beautiful, and economic solution. The company was started in 2010 by two young 20-something graduates from Centrale Paris, Laetitia Brottier and Jér&ocirc;me Mouterde, and already the company has installed its pilot system in the South of France and expect to commercialize the DualSun system in 2012. &nbsp;Wow! &nbsp;They also recently won the &quot;2011 Grand Prix de l&#39;Innovation&quot; for the Eco-Innovations category. So how does a young French startup move so quickly given relatively high-capital needs? &nbsp;Despite the absence of endless venture capitalists that are so prevalent in the American startup culture, there is a plethora of financial and strategic resources here-- from big companies to business angels to most importantly, public entities (regional, national, and on the European level); ADEME, ARENE, PACA, OSEO to name a few (the French love their acronyms). It&#39;s easy for a small French startup to get lost in the complexity of this rich &quot;ecosystem&quot;, paving way for intermediary consulting companies like Ecosys&nbsp;and Alma Consulting, to facilitate the interactions between the various actors. In fact, I was at a conference yesterday organized by Alma Consulting on the &quot;Development of Eco-technologies&quot; where Pete Pierce, the VP of Business Development of Solaire 2G was one of the roundtable participants. Pierce confirmed that in order to finance Solaire 2G&#39;s pilot project, which was on the order of 250keur, Solaire 2G received funding from 25 different contributors (including ADEME, PACA, CG13, OSEO, and Total). Lots of players. &nbsp;Small sums. As a French startup, you really have to know where to look. &nbsp;And clearly, Solaire 2G has figured out where to look. Also to note, one consensus of yesterday&#39;s conference was that the French cleantech ecosystem is great for providing front-end support for new technologies, namely research and development, and less great at providing back-end support, in other words, commercialization. And as Pete Pierce described the financing process, for every $1 spent on the technology, you generally need to spend $5 on commercialization in order to be successful. &nbsp;Hopefully the French ecosystem will evolve quickly enough to provide the support Solaire 2G needs in order to reach its ambitious commercialization plan. &nbsp;" />

<p>Standard PV panels are about 15% efficient, and effectively the remaining 85% is lost -- as heat. &nbsp;Solaire 2G's design includes a heat exchanger that extracts this "waste heat" to be used for the building's water-heating. &nbsp;Solaire 2G's "DualSun" panels can therefore provide 100% of a building's electricity needs and u<a href="http://www.les-ecos-de-capenergies.fr/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Solar2G-Plaquette1.pdf">p to 65% of hot water needs</a>.</p>
<p>The solar electrical/thermal cogeneration concept is not particularly new, as we've seen with others like <a title="EchoFirst Inc.  Solar energy is good.  Echo makes it even better." href="http://wattnow.org/611/echofirst-inc-solar-energy-is-good-echo-makes-it-even-better">EchoFirst</a>. &nbsp;But Solaire 2G's innovative design and <a href="http://www.innovation-paris.com/pdf/finalistes/Solaire2G.pdf">two solid patents</a> optimize size, weight, and fabrication to provide a compact, beautiful, and economic solution.</p>
