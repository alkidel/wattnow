<meta name="description" content="GreenShields, based just outside of Chicago in Highland Park, IL, is a project to retrofit traditional school buses with a Plexiglas shield to reduce drag and therefore reduce fuel consumption by up to 28%. Plexiglas shield to improve the aerodynamics of a school bus. &nbsp;&nbsp;GreenShields is run by a bunch of teenagers, led by Jonny Cohen, 16, the genius behind the project - the idea for which he had when he was 12. Jonny Cohen, inventor of GreenShields&nbsp; Are you feeling depressed that a 12-year-old had more creative ingenuity than you do? I admit I felt that way at first. &nbsp;But now, I&#39;m just really inspired. &nbsp;Jonny had a patent application ready, but decided to withdraw it, because he says &quot;I&#39;m not necessarily looking to make money off this. &nbsp;I want to make as big of a difference as possible&quot;. And what I find exciting about this project is that a small, simple adjustment to an existing system can make a huge impact. &nbsp;When you consider that a school bus has a fuel efficiency of about 8 mpg, and that adding a simple piece of plastic could improve that mileage by 2 -3 mpg, that&#39;s huge! &nbsp;Especially when we&#39;re talking about hundreds of thousands of school buses in the US alone. Jonny Cohen and his team won a $25,000 grant from Pepsi and Jonny was recently highlighted on Forbes&#39; 30 under 30: Energy list." />
