    <p><a href="http://www.skysails.info/index.php?L=1">SkySails</a>, located in Hamburg, Germany, is the market leader in wind propulsion by automated towing kite systems. &nbsp;In other words, SkySails designs high-altitude flying <strong>kites </strong>attached to cargo ships that essentially "pull" the ships, <a href="http://www.skysails.info/fileadmin/user_upload/Presselounge/Dokumente/englisch/EN_SkySails_Press_Kit.pdf">reducing the ship's fuel costs and CO2 emissions by 10-35%</a>.</p>

<p>As we've seen with <a href="http://wattnow.org/1148/makani-power-high-capacity-wind">Makani Power</a> and <a href="http://wattnow.org/95/altaeros-energies">Altaeros</a>, high-altitude wind is a popular area for exploration these days. &nbsp;What's the big deal? &nbsp;To put it simply, wind velocity increases exponentially with height, and power is a cubic function of wind velocity. &nbsp;In other words, <a href="http://www.skysails.info/fileadmin/user_upload/Presselounge/Dokumente/englisch/EN_SkySails_Press_Kit.pdf">8-27 times more power</a> is generated at an altitude of ~600m compared to ground level. &nbsp;No wonder there's so many people exploring how to harness energy from this extremely powerful resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skysails.info/fileadmin/user_upload/Presselounge/Dokumente/englisch/EN_SkySails_Press_Kit.pdf"><img class="size-full wp-image-1485 " title="skysails - hellman exponential" src="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/skysails-hellman-exponential.png" alt="" width="410" height="272" /></a></p>

<p>The SkySails system is composed of a towing kite, a towing rope, and a control system located on-board to steer the kite. &nbsp;The kite is launched and recovered using a telescopic mast which takes about 10-20 minutes.</p>
<p>In operation, the SkySails kite hovers at an altitude of 100-500m &nbsp;and performs figure-8 maneuvers generating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractive_force">tractive</a> or pulling force of 320 kilonewton (kN) on the rope, and producing 5-25 times more power per square meter sail area than conventional sails. &nbsp;The latest SkySails product (SKS C 320) has a maximal propulsion power of <a href="http://www.skysails.info/english/skysails-marine/skysails-propulsion-for-cargo-ships/advantages/">more than 2 MW</a>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skysails.info/english/skysails-marine/skysails-propulsion-for-cargo-ships/advantages/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1486  " title="skysails - ship and kite" src="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/skysails-ship-and-kite.png" alt="" width="484" height="268" /></a></p>

<p>We probably don't realize that 90% of world trade is being transported by sea, producing 3% of the world's CO2 emissions. &nbsp;By applying kite propulsion technology to the shipping industry, SkySails is taking full advantage of the <a href="http://www.skysails.info/english/skysails-marine/skysails-propulsion-for-cargo-ships/advantages/">"enormous free wind energy potential on the high seas"</a>&nbsp;to reduce costs (~6 cents / kWh, half the cost of the kWh from the main engine) and cut CO2 emissions. &nbsp;SkySails have been in operation in commercial cargo shipping since 2008, and they recently signed a deal with SolarWaterWorld to develop a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.skysails.info/fileadmin/user_upload/Presselounge/Dokumente/englisch/111027_EN_Press_Release_SWW_SKS.pdf">zero-emission solar yacht with towing-kite propulsion</a>.</p>
<p>SkySails received 15million euro in its latest round of VC-funding which was Germany's biggest VC cleantech investment in 2010 - goes to show you that the nascent VC culture in Europe is very different from that of the US, where 15million euros is really not much.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://www.dsm.com/en_US/cworld/public/media/downloads/publications/backgrounder_skysails_new_energy_for_shipping_with_relevant_sources.pdf">President of DSM, one of SkySails investors, describes</a>&nbsp;SkySails'&nbsp;technology, "For us, SkySails is not simply an ecological ship propulsion system, but more importantly THE key technology for capturing the potential of high altitude wind in a wide range of sustainable innovations for diverse markets".</p>
<p>And in fact,&nbsp;SkySails is going beyond maritime transport and <a href="http://www.skysails.info/english/power/power-system/">developing a power system</a>&nbsp;to generate electricity using high-altitude kite technology. &nbsp;This could be huge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skysails.info/english/power/power-system/compelling-technology/"><img class="size-full wp-image-1493 " title="skysails - power" src="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/01/skysails-power1.png" alt="" width="523" height="266" /></a></p>

<p>Thanks to my friend Celia for the heads up about this extremely innovative company.</p>
