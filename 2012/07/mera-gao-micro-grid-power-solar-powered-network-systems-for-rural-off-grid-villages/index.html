<meta name="description" content="The world&#39;s off-grid population - who are also the world&#39;s poorest - not only rely on dirty and unsafe sources for their energy needs (kerosene for lighting, charcoal for cooking), but they are also paying a much higher price for energy needs than their grid-connected counterparts. We&#39;ve seen a number of off-grid projects respond to this energy economics paradox, such as EGG-Energy, Simpa Networks, EarthSpark International, and now we&#39;re seeing something in between no-grid and grid:&nbsp;the microgrid. Mera Gao Micro Grid Power&nbsp;is a &quot;micro-lighting utility&quot; , installing local grid systems in Uttar Pradesh, an Indian region close to the Nepalese border. &nbsp;The MGP system simply consists of four solar panels, enough to power 100 households, which are mounted onto a household, a battery bank to provide 2-days worth of electricity, a low-voltage power distribution network, LED lamps for households. The microgrid may not be as efficient per kwh as a traditional grid system, but the MGP microgrid is a low-investment, quick-to-market solution that can eventually be scaled and interconnected. Mera Gao (meaning &quot;My Village&quot; in Hindi) is constantly and cleverly optimizing their microgrid design to reduce costs and provide a robust system. &nbsp;For instance, the system runs at low-voltage (24V), allowing to use aluminum wiring, rather than expensive copper wiring which is needed for high-voltage transmission (and which also leads to copper theft). &nbsp;Another design feature to be included is that&nbsp;circuit breakers will trip if someone tries to steal electricity. Mera Gao MGP provides the capital investment of the system,&nbsp;which is about $2500. &nbsp;In return, the customers of the community sign up and pay a small initiation fee and receive 2-4 LED lamps, followed by a&nbsp;monthly &quot;subscription&quot; of 100 rupees ($2). &nbsp;This fee covers .2 amps for 7 hours per night, enough to power two LED lights and a mobile charger. &nbsp;Normally, a household will pay 100-150 rupees for these services, so the economic transition payoff is immediate for the customer. The lack of investment is extremely important for adoption of the system - we&#39;ve seen that with retail models selling individual solar lamps and systems, the upfront cost is often a huge barrier&nbsp;for customers to make the transition from kerosene to solar, even if the breakeven point comes after just a couple months. &nbsp;This challenge has led to many creative lending and rent-to-own business models as seen with Eight19 and Simpa Networks. &nbsp; Mera Gao MGP is a for-profit social enterprise, striving for a 15% minimum return on investment (ROI) for investors. &nbsp; With MGP&#39;s model, returns start coming in after about a year and half, making it a win-win situation for all. Since last summer, Mera Gao has installed systems in 9 villages and hopes to reach another 70 villages (providing electricity for 3,000 customers) by the end of this year! The microgrid is undoubtedly a promising solution for communities lacking basic energy needs - but as the Rocky Mountain Institute perscribes, could the microgrid also be the necessary foundation for a more intelligent, electrified, efficient energy system of the future for us all?" />
