<meta name="description" content="I&nbsp;was inspired to approach the topic of low-carbon travel, after reading&nbsp;Sustainable Energy - without the hot air&nbsp;and realizing that no matter how much effort you make in your daily life to reduce your carbon emissions and live efficiently - take shorter showers, turn down the heat, avoid using a car, eat less meat - as soon as you step onto an airplane, all those nice &quot;efforts&quot; are sadly erased. As author David MacKay explains, taking one intercontinental roundtrip flight (say London-Los Angeles) consumes approximately 12,000kWh per person&nbsp;-&nbsp;about 30kWh/day for one year.&nbsp; To put that into perspective, that&#39;s like leaving your heater on 24/day every day for one whole year.&nbsp; And that&#39;s just one flight!&nbsp; If you had to pay that much energy in electricity bills, that&#39;d be $1204 in the US ($2080 in France, and $3942 in Germany!). What does that mean for expat globetrotters&nbsp;who love to travel and&nbsp;take (gulp) multiple intercontinental flights per year?&nbsp; Is there hope that airplanes will become more efficient?&nbsp; Unfortunately, not really.&nbsp; Aircraft manufacturers are looking to make planes lighter and to increase capacity, but airplanes will still remain gas guzzling beasts. But what if - we used the sun to power airplanes? &nbsp; Solar Impulse, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, is a solar power plane project founded in 2003 by Bertrand Piccard and André Borschberg, and financed by private companies (the four major partners are Solvay, Schindler, Omega, and Deutsche Bank). Solar-powered planes do exist! Solar Impulse&#39;s first aircraft, the HB-SIA,&nbsp;is a prototype aircraft with 11,628 PV cells, a wingspan of 63.4 meters, a cruise speed of 70 km/hour, and a carrying capacity of 1 person. Ok, so maybe an airplane that has the same wingspan as an Airbus A340, but goes slower than your grandmother driving and carries 1 measly person might not seem that impressive. &nbsp;But this is the &quot;revenge of Icarus&quot; - an airplane that can fly day and night without using fuel. &nbsp;This is huge! Why can&#39;t the plan go faster and hold more people? &nbsp;The project&#39;s major design constraint is the weight and power capacity of the lithium polymer batteries. This being said, the HB-SIA successfully performed a 26-hour flight in July 2010, a 13-hour international flight in May 2011 (from Switzerland to Belgium), and in the upcoming weeks will perform a 2,500km, 48-hour journey from Switzerland to Morocco -- all being practice flights for a round-the-world flight in 2014&nbsp;with the upgraded HB-SIB model. Solar Impulse recognizes that its solar plane project will not revolutionize the aviation industry in the near-term, but they hope to demonstrate that &quot;progress is possible using clean forms of energy&quot;. &quot;Our airplane is not designed to carry passengers, but to carry a message.&quot; Bertrand Piccard I agree that Solar Impulse projects a strong message about the potential of renewable energies - but I am also optimistic (naive maybe?) that solar-powered commercial aviation could one day become a reality. In the meantime, what should we do about flying? &nbsp;Try to take direct flights instead of flights with stops. &nbsp;Better yet, take a train instead if possible. &nbsp;Better yet, think twice about making the trip.
