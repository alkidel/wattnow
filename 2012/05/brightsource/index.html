<p><a href="http://www.solarthermalmagazine.com/2010/06/02/largest-solar-thermal-energy-project-in-the-southern-hemisphere/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2133" title="areva-solar-thermal-farm-solar-thermal-magazine" src="/assets/from-wordpress/uploads/2012/05/areva-solar-thermal-farm-solar-thermal-magazine1.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="240" /></a></p>

<p>Unlike PV, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics">converts solar energy directly into DC electric power</a>&nbsp;using semiconductor materials and the photoelectric effect, the basic principle of CSP is to use solar energy to heat water.</p>
<p>From there, the&nbsp;CSP system closely resembles a conventional power plant (re. coal, gas, nuclear):&nbsp;the&nbsp;hot water becomes high temperature steam to&nbsp;operate a turbine which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/">BrightSource Energy</a>&nbsp; </strong>is an Oakland, CA-based CSP "startup" that was founded in 2004, raised over $160 million in funding, and already has&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/the-story-behind-brightsources-ditched-ipo/">13 orders for solar thermal power plants </a>to be built between now and 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BrightSource's&nbsp;CSP design is a <a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/technology/how_lpt_works/">solar tower design</a>, where&nbsp;dual-axis rotating heliostats (mirrors) concentrate sun rays onto a central tower (boiler) which captures the heat and &nbsp;generates pressurized steam, which is then piped to a conventional steam turbine generator.</p>

<p>BrightSource was planning for an IPO this year in order to raise an additional $250 million in funding, but <a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/the-story-behind-brightsources-ditched-ipo/">recently withdrew the IPO </a>due to weak markets and decreasing (and therefore competing) costs from PV markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So does&nbsp;CSP really have a future if PV solar keeps getting cheaper and cheaper?&nbsp; The answer is, <strong>yes.</strong></p>
<p>PV solar and thermal solar are largely complimentary technologies,&nbsp;and where PV solar is modular, flexible, and can be built close to the consumer,&nbsp;CSP offers two major advantages over PV:</p>

<div>CSP-generated power <strong>can be stored</strong> as heat.&nbsp; See BrightSolar's <a href="http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/technology/how_lpt_works/">SolarPLUS system.</a></div>

<p>CSP systems are especially efficient in hot,&nbsp;arid, and semi-arid regions, and costs are going down as the industry matures.&nbsp; The&nbsp;International Energy Agency estimates that <a href="http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf">CSP technologies will be cost competitive</a>&nbsp;with conventional technologies for peak and intermediate loads by about 2020.</p>
