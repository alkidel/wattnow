<meta name="description" content="Highview Power Storage&nbsp;is a London-based startup developing a frozen air (or &quot;liquid air&quot;) technology for grid-scale storage applications. Many interesting grid-scale storage technologies have cropped up in recent years including&nbsp;liquid batteries, compressed air storage, storage through electric vehicles, lithion ion&nbsp;- and the need is clear: if we want successful integration of intermittent renewables (ie. solar, wind) in grid infrastructure, energy storage is a key component -- as well as a major challenge, as&nbsp;we&#39;ve already discussed. Highview is commercializing the Cryo Energy System&nbsp;and the Cryo GenSet, systems based on inventor Peter Dearman&#39;s 50-year old idea to &quot;store energy in cold&quot;. The &#39;frozen air&#39; energy process begins during off-peak hours, when electricity generated by renewables is used to cool air down to -310F, turning the air from gas to liquid. &nbsp;The croygenic &#39;liquid air&#39; is stored in a vacuum tank, and when electricity demand grows, the liquid air is warmed to ambient temperature, and the resulting increase in pressure drives a turbine for generating electricity. &nbsp; Highview has built and successfully operated a pilot at the Slough Heat &amp; Power station&nbsp;since 2010, and they expect to build commercial-scale projects in the upcoming year. Highview admits that the current process is only about 25% efficient, but once systems are produced at scale, the conversion could be up to 70% efficient.
