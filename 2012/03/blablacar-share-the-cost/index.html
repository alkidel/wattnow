<meta name="description" content="Founded in 2006, BlablaCar is a European car-sharing website with over 1.6 million members in France, Spain, and the UK. &nbsp;The site connects drivers with empty seats and paying passengers -- with the objective to reduce cost and carbon emissions for all involved. &nbsp;And above all, the site encourages social &quot;blabla&quot; fixtures such as profiles and ratings to assure a trustworthy ride-sharing community. The average car occupancy rate in Europe is 1.2 persons / car, which is inefficient, not very environmentally friendly, and simply expensive. &nbsp;BlablaCar estimates that average&nbsp;car ownership costs in Europe exceed 5,500 euros per year. BlablaCar&#39;s average car occupancy rate has increased to 2.7 persons / car, and depending on how frequently a driver uses the site, he or she can easily offset over half of car-owner costs&nbsp;by &quot;renting&quot; out his or her car seats. Moreover, with every added passenger, a driver will greatly reduce his or her carbon footprint! &nbsp;Check out this infographic from One Block Off the Grid to compare CO2 emissions from various modes of transport. BlablaCar is free for drivers and passengers alike to post trips / use the site. &nbsp;The business model is based on taking a small commission&nbsp;(2eur / passenger / ride) on hundreds of thousands of trips per month. The process is simple. &nbsp;Let&#39;s say I plan on traveling from Paris to Bordeaux this Friday. &nbsp;I type in my departure city and my arrival city and the date I plan on traveling. Blablacar (branded as &quot;Covoiturage.fr&quot; in France) returns a list options based on the route and the desired date. &nbsp;I click on the first result, which gives me a detailed profile of the driver and the trip. Mika has an excellent rating (5 stars) with 33 reviews. &nbsp;He likes to listen to music and chat (&quot;blabla&quot;) and doesn&#39;t accept smokers. Perfect! There&#39;s only one seat left in Mika&#39;s car so I sign up and reserve that last seat. &nbsp;Easy, right? BlablaCar is nominated for the EcoSummit Award 2012, an award for the best smart green startup (Brite and SolarFuel, two companies I wrote about last week are also nominated). &nbsp;Out of 52 nominees, a whopping 9 are car-sharing programs, mostly German-based companies. The car-sharing system is clearly easy to implement and can have an immediate positive environmental impact. &nbsp;Now it&#39;s a question of form and reputation - who can design it best and reach out to the most people possible? &nbsp;BlablaCar, with its&nbsp;ultra-simple interface and established community, definitely seems to have a one-up on the competitors." />
