<meta name="description" content="SolarFuel, a Stuttgart, Germany-based startup, is developing a Power-to-Gas (P2G) technology which converts wind and solar-generated electricity &nbsp;into &quot;storable&quot; synthetic CO2-neutral natural gas. The key challenge facing the successful integration of renewable sources (re. solar, wind) into grid infrastructure is&nbsp;intermittency. Renewable electricity is generated irregularly - when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. &nbsp;Ironically, especially with respect to solar, panels are often most efficient when demand is lowest (during the day). &nbsp;And sometimes too much electricity is generated and can not be re-inserted into the grid, leading to a waste of electricity. Energy storage is therefore a key necessity to the adoption of renewables. &nbsp;However, as we have seen with projects like LightSail Energy, storage technologies are currently prohibitively expensive to be used at grid-scale. Enter SolarFuel. The traditional energy model uses gas to generate electricity. &nbsp;However, now that we have this &quot;surplus&quot; of renewable-generated electricity, SolarFuel has turned the classic energy model on its head -- to convert electricity into natural gas, which is efficient, CO2 neutral - and most importably, storable. Developed at ZSW and FraunhoferIWES, two German research centers, SolarFuel&#39;s process mimics photosynthesis to convert CO2 into usable fuel. First, renewable-generated electricity is used to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis. The second step is a methanation process which combines the separated hydrogen with ambient CO2 to produce methane (CH4), which can be used as directly as an automotive fuel (efficiency of 60%) or then reconverted into electricity, a process described as power to gas to power, or P2G2P (efficiency of 40%). SolarFuel&#39;s first customer, carmaker Audi, plans to offer CO2 neutral mobility by: Investing in four 3.6 MW offshore wind turbines, Building a SolarFuel 6.3 MW P2G plant. SolarFuel&#39;s plant will convert the wind-generated electricity into natural gas and will be operational in 2013, in time for Audi&#39;s new compressed natural gas car model, A3 TCNG. In all, SolarFuel&#39;s revolutionary P2G technology responds to the challenge of intermittency with a creative system that elegantly combines&nbsp;renewable energy, energy conversion, storage, and transportation." />
