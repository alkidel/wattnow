<meta name="description" content="Italian artist / ecologist&nbsp;Ivano Vitali combines newspaper recycling and knitting to produce extraordinarily-woven clothing and objects. Vitali upcycles old newspaper by cutting the newspaper into strips, twisting and overlapping the strips into taut long string pieces which he then rolls into a &quot;newspaper yarn ball&quot; - without the use of dyes nor glue. With large custom-made knitting needles (up to 8 feet long!), Vitali then weaves the paper yarn into a variety of objects - from dresses to tapestries to chair seats. Vitali has been using waste paper as a medium for his art since 1995, and he describes the purpose of his work : &quot;My primary aim remains the communication of the ecological message to all the peoples of the earth, because I believe that well being and happiness are dependent upon a respect for the environment, and I am therefore convinced that every person, without exception, must stand for the defense of planet earth against any form of pollution&quot;.
