<meta name="description" content="Imagine you order a camera or a new book online, and several days later, you find out that your purchase also contributed to the investment of a solar project. Do The Bright Thing, based in the Netherlands, has developed a creative financing model for solar projects through online shopping. &nbsp;With Do The Bright Thing&#39;s shopping platform, shoppers can chose from over 1 million products, and for every purchase made through the site, 10% of the purchase value is invested in solar energy. How does it work? &nbsp;For the shopper, there&#39;s really no difference or premium in his or her shopping experience. &nbsp;Do The Bright Thing is free to join, and the price of the products is the same as if the shopper bought it elsewhere. &nbsp;Do The Bright Thing has partnered with 300 shopping sites and offers over 1 million products. Do The Bright Thing partners with manufacturers and distributors to sell the products on their website, and a percentage of the sale goes to Do The Bright Thing to invest in solar. For each product offered, Do The Bright Thing calculates the product&#39;s &quot;embedded energy&quot;, the energy needed to manufacture the product, and will invest in enough solar power to offset that embedded energy - thus, the customer can finish shopping with a slightly clearer conscious regarding the environmental impact of his or her purchases. Moreover, within 60 days of a shopper&#39;s purchase, the solar energy associated with the purchase will be installed - and verified by an independent advisory board. &nbsp;The shopper can then follow the progress and details of the solar power installed from his or her purchase. Do The Bright Thing&#39;s shopping platform is currently only operating in the Netherlands but the group plans to expand in the upcoming months. &nbsp;Do The Bright Thing has also partnered with Fair Climate Fund&nbsp;to adhere to a commitment of installing 5% of solar panels in developing countries. From my perspective, there are two interesting concepts being addressed through Do The Bright Thing&#39;s model: a) raising investment capital in a clever way, and b) empowering individuals with solar power commitment. One big issue with solar power is the financial investment profile. &nbsp;Even though solar will pay back eventually, that initial investment will often be a huge turnoff - for individuals and investors. &nbsp;But if the cash is available, solar IS a good investment. &nbsp;And Do The Bright Thing has figured out a creative way to raise that initial cash necessary. And second, by coupling online shopping (in a way that does not detract from the shopper&#39;s experience) with solar investment, the individual shopper is inadvertently empowered - empowered to contribute and be part of an energy project. &nbsp;And the shopper can then follow the progress of the solar project - just like Kiva investors can follow the progress of their investments in micro-entrepreneurs. &nbsp;This connection educates and enlightens the shopper, and most of all, helps the shopper recognize that he or she as an individual, can make a difference." />
